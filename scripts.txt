INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why we’re here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about “We should go out”? This is what they’re talking about...this whole thing, we’re all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, we’re all out! There are people tryin’ to find us, they don’t know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) “Did you ring?, I can’t find him.” “Where did he go?” “He didn’t tell me where he was going”. He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then you’re standing around, whatta you do? You go: “We gotta be getting back”. Once you’re out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, it’s my feeling, you’ve gotta go.



INT. PETE’S LUNCHEONETTE – DAY

(Jerry and George sit at a table, having coffee.)

JERRY: (pointing at George’s shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. It’s too high! It’s in no-man’s-land. You look like you live with your mother.

GEORGE: Are you through? 

JERRY: You do of course try on, when you buy?

GEORGE: Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don’t actually recall considering the buttons.

JERRY: Oh, you don’t recall?

GEORGE: (on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.

JERRY: Well, senator, I’d just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.

(A waitress, Claire, approaches the table. She pours refills Jerry’s coffee.)

CLAIRE: Mr. Seinfeld. Mr. Costanza. 

(Claire tries to refill George’s coffee, but George blocks her.)

GEORGE: Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where’s the orange indicator?

CLAIRE: It’s missing, I have to do it in my head: decaf left, regular right, decaf left, regular right...it’s very challenging work.

JERRY: Can you relax, it’s a cup of coffee. Claire is a professional waitress.

CLAIRE: Trust me George. No one has any interest in seeing you on caffeine.

(Claire exits.)

GEORGE: How come you’re not doin’ the second show tomorrow?

JERRY: Well, there’s this uh, woman might be comin’ in.

GEORGE: Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?

JERRY: I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?

GEORGE: No, you didn’t!

JERRY: I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing... 

GEORGE: Ha.

JERRY: (looks in the creamer) There’s no milk in here, what...

GEORGE: Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?

JERRY: Oh, she’s really great. I mean, she’s got like a real warmth about her and she’s really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.

GEORGE: (smiling) So, you know, what, what happened?

JERRY: Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.

GEORGE: Oh, nothing happened, but it was...

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: This is great!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!

JERRY: Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and maybe we’ll get together. 

GEORGE: (whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, ‘Had to’? ‘Had to’ come in?

JERRY: Yeah, but...

GEORGE: ‘Had to come in’ and ‘maybe we’ll get together’? ‘Had to’ and ‘maybe’?

JERRY: Yeah!

GEORGE: No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. You’re not gonna see this woman.

JERRY: What, are you serious...why, why did she call?

GEORGE: How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite. 

JERRY: To be polite? You are insane!

GEORGE: All right, all right, I didn’t want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?

JERRY: Yes!

GEORGE: You’re a back-up, you’re a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!

JERRY: Oh, I get it, this is about the button.

(Claire passes the table; George stops her and writes something on his notepad.)

GEORGE: Claire, Claire, you’re a woman, right?

CLAIRE: What gave it away, George?

GEORGE: Uhm...I’d like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.

JERRY (to George) Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now, how is she gonna know?

GEORGE: (to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right? 

CLAIE: Uh huh.

GEORGE: She says she ‘has to’ come to New York on business...

JERRY: Oh you are beautiful!

GEORGE: ...and, and ‘maybe’ she’ll see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?

CLAIRE: I’d have to say, uuhh, no. 

(George shows his note-block to Jerry; it says very largely: NO.)

GEORGE (to Claire) So why did she call?

CLAIRE: To be polite.

GEORGE: To be polite. I rest my case.

JERRY: Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you’re talking about, now, come on, come with me. (stands up) I gotta go get my stuff out of the dryer anyway.

GEORGE: I’m not gonna watch you do laundry.

JERRY: Oh, come on, be a come-with guy.

GEORGE: Come on, I’m tired.

CLAIRE: (to Jerry) Don’t worry, I gave him a little caffeine. He’ll perk up.

GEORGE: (panicking) Right, I knew I felt something!

(Claire exits, smiling.)



INT. LAUNDRAMAT - DAY

(Jerry and George are there; George is staring at one of the dryers.)

GEORGE: Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment I’ve ever experienced. 

(George walks away from the dryer. A man passes by.)

JERRY: Well, look at this guy. Look, he’s got everything, he’s got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners. This is not his first load.

GEORGE: I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...

JERRY: And you didn’t even hear how she sounded.

GEORGE: What?!

JERRY: Laura.

GEORGE: I can’t believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!

JERRY: Yeah, but how could you be so sure?

GEORGE: ‘Cause it’s signals, Jerry, it’s signals! (snapping his fingers) Don’t you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin’ tomorrow night, if you were busy?

JERRY: No.

GEORGE: She calls you today and she doesn’t make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? It’s Saturday night!

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: What is that? It’s ridiculous! You don’t even know what hotel she’s staying at, you can’t call her. That’s a signal, Jerry, that’s a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!

JERRY: Maybe you’re right.

GEORGE: Maybe I’m right? Of course I’m right.

JERRY: This is insane. You know, I don’t even know where she’s staying! She, she’s not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.

(George puts his arm around Jerry.)

GEORGE: I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why don’t you just see if it’s dry?

JERRY: No no no, don’t interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what it’s doing. Just let it finish.

GEORGE: You’re gonna overdry it.

JERRY: You, you can’t overdry.

GEORGE: Why not?

JERRY: Same as you can’t overwet. You see, once something is wet, it’s wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die you’re dead, right? Let’s say you drop dead and I shoot you. You’re not gonna die again, you’re already dead. You can’t overdie, you can’t overdry.

GEORGE: (to the other laundry patrons) Any questions?

JERRY: How could she not tell me where she was staying? 

(George stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it. The dryer stops working and he closes the lid.)

GEORGE: Look at that. They’re done! 



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, peforming.)

JERRY: Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...y’know, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, it’s dark, there’s bubbles happening, they’re all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, “C’mon babe, let’s go”. You come by, you open up the lid and they’ll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, they’re in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, “Tomorrow, the dryer, I’m goin’. You wait here!” The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you don’t see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So they’re showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isn’t your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first. 



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry is on the couch, watching TV. The phone rings. He picks up the reciever.)

JERRY: (answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, don’t say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, I’m sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no 

(There’s a knock at the door.)

JERRY: (to the door) Yeah?

(Kessler enters.)

KESSLER: Are you up?

JERRY: (to Kessler) Yeah. (to the phone) Yeah, people do move. Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem.

(Jerry hangs up.)

KESSLER: Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh? 

JERRY: (upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, it’s a tape! I taped the game, it’s one o’clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.

KESSLER: Hey, I’m sorry, I- you know, I, I thought you knew. (takes two loaves of bread out of his pockets, and holds them out to Jerry.) You got any meat?

JERRY: Meat? I don’t, I don’t know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?

KESSLER: (from the refrigerator) What happened? Well, they STUNK, that’s what happened!

(He takes some meat from the refrigerator and closes it.)

KESSLER: You know, I almost wound up going to that game.

JERRY: (cynical) Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven’t been out of the building in ten years!

KESSLER: Yeah. (Jerry sits down on the couch. Kessler walks over with his sandwich and looks at Jerry and uses expressions to ask Jerry to move the newspapers on the other side of the couch so he could site down. Kessler sits down next to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry gives him a look as if to say, “Do you mind?”) Are you done with this?

JERRY: No.

(Kessler glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the magazine back on the table.)

KESSLER: When you’re done, let me know.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.

KESSLER: I thought I wasn’t allowed to be in here this weekend.

JERRY: No, it’s okay now, that, that girl is not comin’. Uh, I misread the whole thing.

KESSLER: You want me to talk to her?

JERRY: I don’t think so.

KESSLER: Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost... a lawyer.

(Kessler shows with his fingers how close he was.)

JERRY: That close, huh?

KESSLER: You better believe it.

(The phone rings. Jerry picks it up.)

JERRY: Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.

KESSLER: Oh, give me it...let me talk to her.

JERRY: (to the phone) No believe me, I’m always up at this hour. How are you?... Great... Sure... What time does the plane get in?... I got my friend George to take me...

KESSLER: (to the TV) SLIDE! Wow!

JERRY: No, it’s, it’s just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, don’t be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, it’s no trouble at all... I’ll see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I don’t believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here! 



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry and George enter, carrying a heavy mattress.)

JERRY: If my father was moving this he’d had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your end’s got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end’s got to come down.'

GEORGE: You know, I can’t believe you’re bringin’ in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why don’t you bring in an extra guy too?

(George takes a seat. Jerry hands him a beer.)

JERRY: Look, it’s a very awkward situation. I don’t wanna be presumptuous.

GEORGE: All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?

JERRY: All right, she said she couldn’t find a decent hotel room...

GEORGE: A decent hotel-room...

JERRY: Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.

GEORGE: You can’t be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal! 

JERRY: (cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?

GEORGE: I think I was affected by the caffeine. 

(Suddenly a dog enters the apartment and jumps George on the couch.)

GEORGE: Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog...

(Kessler enters and closes the door.)

KESSLER: Hey, he really likes you, George.

GEORGE: Well, that’s flattering. 

(The dog heads for the bathroom and starts drinking from the toilet.)

KESSLER: Oh, he’s gettin’ a drink of water. (pointing to the mattress) Is this for that girl?

JERRY: Yeah.

KESSLER: Why even give her an option?

JERRY: This is a person I like, it’s not “How to score on spring break”.

GEORGE: Right, can we go? ‘Cause I’m double-parked, I’m gonna get a ticket.

JERRY: Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.

GEORGE: So what? That’s good.

JERRY: Now, how could that be good?

GEORGE: Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin’ around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin’ over, “I’ve gotta tidy up?” Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.

JERRY: This is how you operate?

GEORGE: Yeah, I wish.

JERRY: Let me just wipe the sink.

KESSLER: Why even give her an option for? 

(Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door.)

KESSLER: (to George, pointing at the mattress) It’s unbelievable.

GEORGE: Yeah.

KESSLER: How’s the real estate-business?

GEORGE: (feeling awkward) It’s uh, not bad, it’s comin’ along. Why? Did you need something.

KRAMER: Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?

GEORGE: Well, I might be getting into that.

KESSLER: (slaps George on the arm) You keep me posted!

GEORGE: I’m aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, let’s go (opens the bathroom door) Let’s go!

(Jerry and the dog come out.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB - NIGHT

(Jerry on stage; performing)

JERRY: The dating world is not a fun world...it’s a pressure world, it’s a world of tension, it’s a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, ‘cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don’t know what they need. I know I don’t have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one I’m- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, we’re all human beings, what is the story? I’ve never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I’ve never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: “I could use a cotton-ball right now.” I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they don’t need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, they’re like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? They’re huge and two days later, they’re out, they’re gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin’ with them? The only time I ever see ‘em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there’s two or three, that look like they’ve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I don’t know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl who’s left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I don’t know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. “Let’s move on.” The dating world is a world of pressure. Let’s face it: a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance you’ll end up naked at the end of it. You know? “Well, Bill, the boss thinks you’re the man for the position, why don’t you strip down and meet some of the people you’ll be workin’ with?” 



INT. AIRPORT – NIGHT

(Jerry and George are waiting for Laura.)

JERRY: Wouldn’t it be great if you could ask a woman what she’s thinking?

GEORGE: What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what she’s thinkin’.

JERRY: You know, instead, I’m like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.

GEORGE: Listen, listen, don’t get worked up, ‘cause you’re gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.

JERRY: Really? How?

GEORGE: ‘Cause it’s all in the greeting. 

JERRY: Uh-huh.

GEORGE: All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, that’s a good sign.

JERRY: Right.

GEORGE: You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.

JERRY: Lip area.

GEORGE: You know a hug: definitely good.

JERRY: Hug is definitely good.

GEORGE: Sure.

JERRY: Although what if it’s one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?

GEORGE: That’s so brutal, I hate that.

JERRY: You know how they do that?

GEORGE: That’s why, you know, a shake is bad.

JERRY: Shake is bad, but what if it’s the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?

GEORGE: Hand sandwich.

JERRY: Right.

GEORGE: I see, well, that’s open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes. 

(A woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her hands over Jerry’s eyes.)

LAURA: Guess who?

JERRY: Hey, hey.

LAURA & JERRY: Heeeey!

(They take each others hands and shake them around. George is looking puzzled.)

JERRY: It’s good to see you.

LAURA: Hi.

JERRY: This is my friend George.

LAURA: Hi, how nice to meet you.

GEORGE: Hi, how are you?

JERRY: This is Laura.

GEORGE: Laura, sure.

JERRY: (to Laura) I can’t believe you’re here.

GEORGE & JERRY: Ooh yeah, the bags, sure. 

(They pick up the bags.)

LAURA: Oh, thank you.

JERRY: (aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?

GEORGE: Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasn’t in the manual, I don’t know.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry is in the midst of showing Laura the apartment.)

JERRY: So uh, what do you think?

LAURA: Ooohhh, wow! This place isn’t so bad.

JERRY: Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?

LAURA: (laughs) Actually, um, do you have any wine?

JERRY: Uh, yeah, I think I do.

LAURA: (referring to a lamp) Oh, do you mind if I turn this down?

JERRY: Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.

(She turns down the lamp.)

LAURA: Uh, Jerry, uh, I was wandering, would it be possible – and if it’s not, fine – for me to stay here tomorrow night too?

(Jerry takes off his shoes to make himself comfortable)

JERRY: Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don’t you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin’ anything?

LAURA: No, I’d love to do something. Uh, I have my seminar in the morning, then after that I’m right open.

JERRY: Really? What would you like to do?

LAURA: Well... now I know this sounds touristy, but I’d just love to go on one of those five-hour boat rides around Manhattan.

JERRY: (unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) I’m just, I’m really glad you’re here.

(The phone rings; he picks it up.)

JERRY: (answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, it’s for you.

LAURA: (to the phone) Hello?... Hi!... No no it was great, right on time... No, I, I’m gonna stay here tomorrow...yes, yes it’s fine... No, we’re goin’ on a boat ride... Don’t be silly... I’m not gonna have this conversation... Look, I’ll call you tomorrow... Okay, bye. (She hangs up the phone.) Never get engaged.

JERRY: (not excited) You’re engaged?

LAURA: You, you really have no idea what it’s like until you actually do it. And I’m on this emotional roller coaster.

JERRY: You’re engaged? 

LAURA: You know, I can’t believe it myself sometimes. You have to start thinking in terms of “we”. Ugh, it’s a very stressful situation.

JERRY: (matter-of-factly) You’re engaged. 

LAURA: Yeah, yeah, he’s a great guy...

JERRY: Yeah.

LAURA: You’d really like him, you know, I can’t wait to get on that boat.

JERRY: Me too!



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I don’t get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, I’m not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, they’re so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, that’s it! It’s the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don’t know ‘bout that, we don’t know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas we’ve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! “I don’t think she likes me.” The amazing thing is, that we still get women, don’t we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. That’s why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like: “Where to meet men?” We’re here, we are everywhere. We’re honking our horns to serve you better.

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: So, I’m on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the...

(He pauses and gestures to audience for response.)
AUDIENCE: Cheque.

JERRY: Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it’s a woman in front of you that’s writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, y’know, ‘cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they don’t know where that is, but the cheque book: they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster: (Jerry “draws” imaginary book from a holster.) “Who do I make it out to? There’s my ID.” There’s something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I don’t know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, “I don’t have any money, but if you’ll contact these people, I’m sure they’ll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I don’t have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?”



INT. VIDEO STORE – NIGHT

(Jerry and Elaine are picking out a movie for the night.)
JERRY: What’s that one?

ELAINE: “Coccoon II: The Return”. I guess they didn’t like it up there.

JERRY: Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y’know Maureen Stapleton, if she gets a craving, she’s probably screamin’ at those aliens, “I gotta have a lo mein!”

ELAINE: Okay, what’re we doing here? I have seen everything.

JERRY: Oh yeah? I don’t believe you’ve seen... this.

(Jerry shows Elaine a movie from the Adult section.)

ELAINE: Oh, lovely.

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: What do you think their parents think?

JERRY: “So, uh, what’s your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?” “Oh, he’s a public fornicator. Yes, he’s a fine boy...”

ELAINE: Y’know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela’s birthday.

JERRY: Pamela? Do I know her?

ELAINE: Yeah, you met her when we were going out.

JERRY: Oh yeah, right...

ELAINE: You have no idea who I’m talking about, do you?

JERRY: (quickly) No.

ELAINE: Blonde hair, remember? Glasses? (pause) Have you totally blocked out the entire time we were a couple?

JERRY: (a lightbulb goes on in his head) Riverside Drive.

ELAINE: Right! In fact... No, never mind...

JERRY: Well, what is it?

ELAINE: Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night at some bar for her birthday, but... (Jerry turns in disgust) you don’t want to go to... that... no.

JERRY: Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little deal here.

ELAINE: What little deal?

JERRY: I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family wedding I have on Saturday.

ELAINE: A wedding? Have you lost it, man?

JERRY: Y’know, my parents are coming in for this...

ELAINE: They’re coming in?

JERRY: Yeah, tomorrow.

ELAINE: Hey, did your father ever get that hair weave?

JERRY: No, no. Still doin’ the big sweep across.

ELAINE: Why does he do that?

JERRY: Doesn’t think anyone can tell. So c’mon, do we have a deal?

ELAINE: A wedding?

JERRY: There’s a lot of people to mock...

ELAINE: All right, what the hell.

JERRY: Great!

WOMAN: When you’re dead, you’re dead. That’s it. You’re not goin’ anywhere...



INT. BAR – NIGHT

(Elaine and Jerry enter.)

ELAINE: C’mon lets go...

JERRY: Was I supposed to bring something?

ELAINE: You could have.

JERRY: I met her one time...

ELAINE: It is not necessary.

JERRY: What did you say then?

ELAINE: Sssshhhhhh!!!

PAMELA: Hi

ELAINE: Hi, Pamela, you remember Jerry.

PAMELA: (shakes Jerry's hand) Yes, we met.

JERRY: Hi, happy birthday.

PAMELA: Thanks, ah, everybody, this is Elaine and Jerry.

GUESTS, JERRY & ELAINE: Hi

JERRY: I didn’t bring anything.

PAMELA: Uh, I put you two right here.

JERRY: Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) I’m sorry, I didn’t know what to bring, nobody told me.

(Jerry and Elaine sit next to each other at a table. Across from Jerry is a strikingly beautiful woman, Vanessa. The piano is playing awful dinner music.)

VANESSA: How big a tip do you think it’d take to get him to stop?

JERRY: I’m in for five...

VANESSA: I’ll supply the hat.

JERRY: (thinking) Uh-oh... What do we have here?

VANESSA: Why don’t you relax and take your jacket off?

JERRY: Oh, I can’t. Uh, I have a tendency to get chilly.

VANESSA: How masculine.

JERRY: Plus I’m wearing short sleeves, I don’t want to expose my tattoos. (Vanessa smiles; thinking) She’s unbelievable!

(The guy beside Vanessa interrupts.)

ROGER: (to Vanessa) Hey, this guy says he knows Bricker.

VANESSA: Oh, you know Bricker! From where?

JERRY: (thinking) What’s going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend, she’s too good to be alone. What’s the difference, I can’t maneouver anyway with Elaine next to me.

VANESSA: (to Jerry) How do you know Pamela?

JERRY: Uh, friend of a friend. And you?

VANESSA: We went to law school together.

ELAINE: (interrupting Jerry's conversation) Oh, Jerry!

JERRY: (turning to Elaine; thinking) Oh no, not now.

ELAINE: I had this dream last night and you were in it.

JERRY: Oh really? (tries turning away in the hopes Elaine gets the hint; thinking) Oh God, I gotta get out of this.

ELAINE: You were you, but, you weren’t you...

JERRY: No kidding. (thinking) Why is this happening? Please, make her stop!

ELAINE: I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and you were standing there, you were looking out the window...

JERRY: (thinking) This is brutal.

ELAINE: You turned around and you had these wooden teeth.

JERRY: How do you like that? (tries to turn away again; thinking)Can I turn now? Is this over? No, I can’t, I can’t. I’m stuck.

ELAINE: (noticing Jerry not wanting to listen; annoyed) Jerry? Are you listening to me?

JERRY: Yes, I heard you.

PAMELA: Elaine, what’s the name of that jewelry store you took me to that time?

JERRY: (thinking) Thank you, Pamela! (turns to talk to Vanessa; to Vanessa) So, you’re a lawyer...

VANESSA: Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.

JERRY: (thinking) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft... (to Vanessa) Of course, they handled my tattoo removal lawsuit.

VANESSA: Oh, that was you?

JERRY: Imagine, spelling “Mom” with two O’s.

VANESSA: Very funny! What do you do?

JERRY: Comedian.

VANESSA: Really? That explains it.

JERRY: (thinking; quickly) Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.

ROGER: Are you ready?

VANESSA: We gotta run. Happy birthday!

(Vanessa and Roger get up an leave. Jerry panics.)

JERRY: (thinking) I can’t believe it. I got nothing! I don’t even know her name! Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft. Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppen... Sagman... Sag...

(A grim stare from Elaine knocks his concentration.)



INT. TAXICAB – NIGHT

(On the ride home from the party. Jerry and Elaine sit in the back seat.)

JERRY: That wasn’t so bad, really.

ELAINE: Y’know, um, you could use a little work on your manners.

JERRY: Why? What did I do?

ELAINE: Wel-Well, I just don’t appreciate these little courtesy responses, like I’m selling you aluminum siding.

JERRY: I was listening!

ELAINE: No! You couldn’t wait to get back to your little... “conversation”.

JERRY: No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.

ELAINE: Uh-huh...

JERRY: Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.

ELAINE: No! No! You had wooden teeth! You had wooden teeth! I didn’t have wooden teeth, you did!

JERRY: All right, so I had wooden teeth, so what?

ELAINE: So nothing! Nothing. (annoyed sigh)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, “Yeah, I got this new thing: Platonic. My idea, my name, callin’ it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- don’t do anything, and go right home. What’d you think? I think it’s going to be big!” I bet you there were other guys in history that tried to get relationships named after them, but it didn’t work. Y’know, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, “Uh, Hi, uh my name’s Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, it’s a Riconic relationship.”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry’s parents, Helen and Morty, are sitting on a pullout couch. Jerry enters.)

JERRY: Hey!

MORTY: Ah, there he is!

JERRY: This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents are in your bed!

HELEN: Y’know, Jerry, we don’t have to do this.

JERRY: What are you talkin’ about? It’s fine, I love having you here.

HELEN: Tomorrow we’ll go to a hotel.

JERRY: Ma, will you stop?

HELEN: No, why should we take over your apartment?

JERRY: I don’t care. I’m sleeping next door.

HELEN: Your friend Kramer doesn’t mind?

JERRY: No, he’s making a bouillabaisse.

JERRY: So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?

MORTY: Depends on the firm.

JERRY: Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?

MORTY: What’s the matter? You need a lawyer?

JERRY: No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I don’t know her name.

MORTY: So why don’t you ask someone who was at the party?

JERRY: Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can’t ask her.

HELEN: Why not?

JERRY: Because it’s complicated. There’s some tension there.

HELEN: He used to go with her.

HELEN: Which one is she?

MORTY: From Maryland. The one who brought you the chocolate covered cherries you didn’t like.

HELEN: Oh yeah, very alert. Warm person.

JERRY: Oh yeah, she’s great.

HELEN: So, how come nothing materialized there?

JERRY: Well, it’s a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...

HELEN: I know what it was.

JERRY: You don’t know what it was.

HELEN: So, what was it?

JERRY: Well, we fight a lot for some reason.

HELEN & MORTY: Oh, well...

JERRY: And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.

(His parents don’t know how to respond.)

HELEN: Well, I think she’s a very attractive girl.

JERRY: Oh, she is, she absolutely is.

HELEN: I can see if there was a weight problem...

JERRY: No, it’s not that. It wasn’t all one-sided.

HELEN: You know, you can’t be so particular. Nobody’s perfect.

JERRY: I know, I know...

MORTY: Y’know Jerry, it’s a good thing I wasn’t so particular.

HELEN: (hits Morty) Idiot. (to Jerry) So who’re you looking for, Sophia Loren?

JERRY: That’s got nothin’ to do with it.

MORTY: How about Loni Anderson?

HELEN: Where do you get Loni Anderson?

MORTY: Why, what’s wrong with Loni Anderson?

HELEN: I like Elaine more than Loni Anderson.

JERRY: What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn’t the one.

HELEN: And this other one’s the one?

JERRY: I dunno, maybe...

MORTY: So ask Elaine there for her number.

JERRY: I can’t. She’ll get upset. I never talk about other women with her, especially this one tonight.

HELEN: How could you still see her if your not interested?

JERRY: We’re friends.

MORTY: Doesn’t sound like you’re friends to me. If you were friends you'd-you’d ask her for the number. Do you know where this other one works?

JERRY: Oh yeah.

MORTY: Well, go up to the office.

HELEN: Up to her office?

MORTY: Go to the building. She goes out to lunch, doesn’t she?

JERRY: I guess.

MORTY: So, you stand in the lobby, by the elevator, and wait for her to come down for lunch.

JERRY: You mean stakeout the lobby?

HELEN: Morty, that’s ridiculous. Just ask Elaine for the number!

MORTY: He doesn’t want to ask Elaine for the number.

HELEN: So you’ve got him standing by the elevator like a dope! What happens when he sees her?

MORTY: He pretends he bumped into her!

JERRY: Y’know what? This is not that bad an idea.



INT. OFFICE BUILDING – DAY

(Jerry and George are staking out Vanessa.)

GEORGE: What does she look like?

JERRY: I dunno. Hard to say.

GEORGE: What actress does she remind you of?

JERRY: Loni Anderson.

GEORGE: Loni Anderson?!

JERRY: What, there’s something wrong with Loni Anderson? (pause) Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate it.

GEORGE: Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th street. Besides, you think I wanna miss this? (chuckles)

JERRY: I’m a little nervous.

GEORGE: Yeah, me too...

JERRY: If I see her, what do I say that I’m doing here in the building?

GEORGE: You came to see me. I work in the building.

JERRY: What do you do?

GEORGE: I’m an architect.

JERRY: You’re an architect?

GEORGE: I’m not?

JERRY: I don’t see architecture comin from you.

GEORGE: (somewhat annoyed) I suppose you could be an architect.

JERRY: I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin’ else.

GEORGE: All right, she’s not even gonna ask, if we see her, which is remote.

JERRY: Well whaddaya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?

GEORGE: We’re having lunch with a friend. He works in the building.

JERRY: What is his name?

GEORGE: Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.

JERRY: Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.

GEORGE: No good? All right, uh how about Art... Cor.....

JERRY: Art Cor...

GEORGE: ...velay.

JERRY: Corvelay?

GEORGE: Yeah, right.

JERRY: Well, what does he do?

GEORGE: He’s an importer.

JERRY: Just imports, no exports?

GEORGE: (annoyed) He’s an importer/exporter, okay? (beat) Elaine ever call you back?

JERRY: No, I guess she’s still mad.

GEORGE: I don’t understand, you never talk to her about other women?

JERRY: Never. (The elevator door opens.) Wait a second. That’s her. On the right.

GEORGE: (anxious) I forgot who I am! Who am I?!

JERRY: You’re you. We’re having lunch with Art Corvelay.

GEORGE: Vandelay!

JERRY: Corvelay!

GEORGE: Let me be the architect! I can do it!

(Jerry ignores George and approaches Vanessa.)

JERRY: Hey, hey. uh Pamela’s birthday party, didn’t I see you there? Jerry.

VANESSA: Sure! Hi!

JERRY: Uh, this is George. (reaches for her name) I’m sorry...

VANESSA: Vanessa.

GEORGE: Nice to meet you.

JERRY: Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.

VANESSA: That’s right! Yea, what’re you doing here?

JERRY: Oh, we’re meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here in the building.

GEORGE: Yeah, Art Vandelay.

VANESSA: Really? Which company?

JERRY & George: (turning to each other) I don’t know. He’s an importer.

VANESSA: Importer?

GEORGE: ...And exporter.

JERRY: He’s an importer/exporter.

GEORGE: (clears his throat) I’m, uh, I’m an architect.

VANESSA: Really. What do you design?

GEORGE: Uh, railroads, uh...

VANESSA: I thought engineers do that.

GEORGE: They can...

JERRY: Y’know I’m sorry you had to leave so early the other night.

VANESSA: Oh, me too. My cousin had to go back to Boston.

JERRY: Oh, that guy was your cousin! (walking in front of George so he gets the picture to leave)

VANESSA: Yeah, and that woman was your...

JERRY: Friend!

GEORGE: I’ll just, uh, get a paper...

JERRY: So, um, do you date uh immature men?

VANESSA: Almost exclusively...



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Helen and Jerry are in the middle of a game of Scrabble. Morty sits on the couch. Helen sings to herself while she tries to form a word.)

HELEN: Bum bum bum bum... I have no letters... Bum bum bum bum...

JERRY: (annoyed) Ma, will you go already?

HELEN: Bum bum bum bum...

(She picks up a nearby dictionary.)

JERRY: What are you doing?!

HELEN: Wait, I just want to see something.

JERRY: You can’t look in there, we’re playing!

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

MORTY: (cleaning his shoes) Good evening, Mr. Kramer!

KRAMER: Hey Morty! (to Jerry) Salad dressing?

JERRY: Look.

HELEN: “Quo”. Is that a word?

JERRY: Maybe!

HELEN: Will you challenge it?

JERRY: Ma, you can’t look up words in the dictionary! (to Morty) Dad, she’s cheating!

KRAMER: “Quo”? That’s not a word.

HELEN: (to Jerry) You’re such a stickler...

JERRY: Well put something down, you’re taking twenty minutes on this. So is Uncle Mac and Artie, they’re all coming over here before the wedding?

HELEN: They’ll be here at two o’clock. Oh, Elaine called. She said she’d be here at two-thirty. And she says “Hope your meeting went well with ‘Art Vandelay’?”

JERRY: She said what?

HELEN: Just what I said, here.

(She hands Jerry the note. He reads it.)

JERRY: She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.

HELEN: She knows what?

JERRY: She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...

(Kramer arranges Mrs. Seinfeld’s tiles, offering her a word.)

HELEN: No, no, no, that won’t do. He may have a “Z”.

MORTY: So, how did she find out?

JERRY: Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.

(While they talk, Kramer has covertly scoped Jerry’s tiles to confirm that Jerry doesn’t have a “Z”. This goes unnoticed by Jerry, who continues to talk with Morty.)

MORTY: So, what are you? Afraid of her?

JERRY: Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?

HELEN: Whatever I wrote down.

JERRY: Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?

HELEN: Who am I, Rich Little?

MORTY: Well, she can’t be too mad. She’s still coming to the wedding.

JERRY: Yeah, but now I’m nervous.

HELEN: Oh, stop it.

(She makes her move and tallies the points.)

JERRY: “Quone”?

HELEN: ...30...31...

JERRY: “Quone”? No, I’m afraid that I’m going to have to challenge that.

(Jerry picks up the dictionary.)

HELEN: ...32...

KRAMER: No, you don’t have to challenge that. That’s a word. That’s a definite word.

JERRY: I am challenging.

KRAMER: Quone. To quone something.

JERRY: Uh-huh.

(Jerry looks up the word.)

HELEN: I’m not playing with you anymore.

MORTY: Quone’s not a word.

JERRY: No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off.

HELEN: (to Kramer) Why did you make me put that down?

KRAMER: Nah, we need a medical dictionary! If a patient gets difficult, you quone him.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT-NEXT DAY

(A few people mingling about, waiting to go to the wedding. [SeinPurgatory] Jerry is talking to Carol.)

CAROL: You want some funny material, you oughta come down to where I work, now that’s a sitcom!

JERRY: You must have quite a time down there.

(Jerry checks his watch.)

CAROL: We got plenty of time.

JERRY: Oh, I’m sorry. I’m just waiting for someone.

UNCLE MAC: Watch what you say to this guy. He’ll put it in his next act!

(Carol and Uncle Mac laugh)

JERRY: Yeah, yeah...

UNCLE MAC: Jerry, did I tell you that I’m writing a book? An autobiography.

JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it.

UNCLE MAC: It’s based on all my experiences!

JERRY: That’s perfect.

(Elaine enters.)

JERRY: Could you excuse me one second? I’m sorry.

(Jerry goes over and greets Elaine.)

JERRY: How do you do? (introducing himself) Uh, Jerry Seinfeld.

ELAINE: Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.

(Awkward sighs from Jerry and Elaine)

JERRY: Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until we get in the car?

ELAINE: Oh no, let’s do it now.

JERRY: All right, the whole elevator business, let me just explain-

ELAINE: Okay.

ARTIE: Jerry, were you goin’ with us?

JERRY: No, I’m gonna take my car.

ARTIE: That’s why I brought the wagon. Why the hell did I bring the wagon?

JERRY: Anyway, you know why I didn’t ask you, I mean I felt so uncomfortable, and you were so annoyed in the cab.

ELAINE: Well, Jerry, I never saw you flirt with anyone before. It was quite the spectacle.

CAROL: Jerry, we’ll see you there. Bye, Elaine.

ELAINE: Oh, bye. Good to see you.

ARTIE: Oh, we didn’t meet.

JERRY: Oh, I’m sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.

(Jerry pronounces the name ‘le-VEEN’.)

ARTIE: (correcting Jerry) Levine.

(Artie pronounces it with a long “I”. Artie exits.)

JERRY: (sarcastically) Yeah, “Levine”. And I’m Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.

ELAINE: Yeah, obviously.

JERRY: I mean, if we’re gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.

ELAINE: Couldn’t agree more.

JERRY: Good.

ELAINE: Good.

JERRY: Good.

ELAINE: Great!

JERRY: Great? Where do you get ‘great’?

ELAINE: It’s great to... talk about... other people...

JERRY: ...Guys?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Uh-huh. Yeah. So, anybody specific?

ELAINE: No. A general guy.

JERRY: Oh really? Elaine Marie Benes...

ELAINE: What? No, it’s not a big deal.

JERRY: No, that’s great! That’s terrific!

ELAINE: No, we just met...

JERRY: Doesn’t matter. What’s the young man’s name? I would like to meet him.

ELAINE: Hmmm, I don’t think so.

JERRY: Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a labourer of some sort?

ELAINE: Wall street.

JERRY: Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.

ELAINE: And he happens to be pretty good lookin’.

JERRY: (pause) All right, sir.

ELAINE: And... he’s hilarious.

JERRY: Now that’s not fair! So where did you meet this guy?

ELAINE: I staked out his health club.

JERRY: Uh huh. When you’re on a stakeout, do you find it’s better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?

(They leave his apartment)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

Jerry is on stage, performing.

JERRY: Y’know I think that even if you’ve had a relationship with someone, or let’s say, especially if you’ve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, it’s very difficult. Isn’t this? It’s hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. It’s like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, “Look, a rabbit.” The other goes, “So? I believe this is your card.” “Look, why don’t we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?”

INT. COMEDY CLUB

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. It’s a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and I’m supposed to feel bad. Is that the way it’s supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldn’t you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. ‘Cause it’s not easy to give someone the toe, you’ve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) “Look at that toe, buddy.” (He puts his foot down.) I mean, that’s really insulting to get the toe, isn’t it?



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT 

(Jerry is packing a suitcase. Elaine is sitting at the table, watching him.)

JERRY: Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) That’s it. Done!

ELAINE: (claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.

JERRY: (proudly) I am...the master packer.

ELAINE: (laughs) Yeah, right, you’re the master packer.

JERRY: What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) You’ve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.

ELAINE: (raising her hand) ‘Scuse me, master packer...

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: Just gimme your keys.

JERRY: All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?

GEORGE: (from the intercom) Yeah.

(Jerry presses the second button, and opens the apartment door.)

ELAINE: Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?

JERRY: Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.

ELAINE: Okay, this is quite a place.

JERRY: There’s more. The refrigerator.

(Jerry opens the fridge.)

JERRY: Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this: No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?

ELAINE: I’ll eat out.

JERRY: One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity: Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.

(George enters.)

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Ready?

JERRY: Yeah, one sec.

(George closes the door.)

GEORGE: Hey, Elaine.

ELAINE: Hi.

GEORGE: Coming to the airport with us?

ELAINE: No, I’m staying here for the weekend. I’m getting a break from my roommate.

GEORGE: Oh, the actress-waitress?

ELAINE: No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of “A Chorus Line”. So, now all day long she’s walking around the apartment singing, “God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it!” She’s gonna get it right in her...

GEORGE: So just kick her out.

ELAINE: She’s on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.

GEORGE: Yeah, well...a little rough finding something good in your price-range. (to Jerry) But you, my friend, may be in luck.

JERRY: I’m not looking.

GEORGE: No no no, this one’s different. This one’s a beauty!

JERRY: Yeah, what’s it like?

GEORGE: I haven’t seen it yet, but it’s a two-bedroom, it’s on the uh, west 83rd, ‘bout a half block from the park?

JERRY: How much?

GEORGE: Uh, twice what you’re payin’ here, but it’s a great building. It’s two bedrooms!

JERRY: Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerry’s back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.

ELAINE: You oughta at least take a look at it.

JERRY: Really? Why?

ELAINE: ‘Cause then I could move in here.

JERRY: Ohhhh...

ELAINE: It’s time you got outta here anyway.

GEORGE: Yeah, tell ‘im. But quickly, I’m double parked here.

ELAINE: Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you can’t have soft cheese...

GEORGE: Let’s not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.

ELAINE: Jerry, come on, you’re doin’ okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldn’t have to live like this.

JERRY: Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.

ELAINE: Well, for me it’s a step up. It’s like moving from Iceland to Finland.

GEORGE: Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?

JERRY: I can’t think about it now. Come on, I’m going to Minneapolis. I got four shows this weekend.
 


INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry enters his apartment with his bags.)

JERRY: Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!

ELAINE: (from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?

JERRY: Great, I had fun. Where’s the TV, where’s the VCR?

(Elaine has a guilty look on her face.)

JERRY: What?

ELAINE: They were stolen.

JERRY: Stolen? When?

ELAINE: A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.

JERRY: Stolen?

(Kramer enters the apartment.)

ELAINE: (looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.

(Elaine enters the bathroom.)

JERRY: (to Kramer) You left the door open?!

KRAMER: Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin’ and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, ‘cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!

JERRY: Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?

KRAMER: (guiltily) The door.

JERRY: The door? You left the door open?

KRAMER: Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.

JERRY: Yeah, and?

KRAMER: Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. “The Bold And The Beautiful”.

JERRY: So the door was wide open?

KRAMER: Wide open!

(Elaine enters the living room.)

JERRY: (to Elaine) And where were you?

ELAINE: I was at Bloomingdale’s... waiting for the shower to heat up.

KRAMER: Look, Jerry, I’m sorry, I’m uh- you have insurance, right buddy?

JERRY: No.

KRAMER: (shocked) How can you not have insurance?

JERRY: Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. It’s the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!

KRAMER: Jerry! I’m gonna find your stuff. I’m gonna solve it, I’m on the case, buddy, I’m on the case.

JERRY: Yeah, don’t investigate, don’t pay me back, it was an accident.

KRAMER: (theatrical) I made a mistake.

ELAINE: These things happen.

KRAMER: I’m human.

JERRY: In your way.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(A policeman is filling out a report. Jerry and Elaine are there.)

POLICEMAN: Let’s see, that’s, one TV, a stereo, one leather jacket, a VCR and a computer...is that ‘bout it?

ELAINE: Answering machine.

JERRY: (disappointed) Answering machine. (jovially) Oh, I hate the idea of somebody out there returning my calls.

POLICEMAN: What do you mean?

JERRY: It’s a joke.

POLICEMAN: I see. Well, mister Seinfeld uh, we’ll look into it and uh, we’ll let you know if we uh, you know, if we find anything.

JERRY: You ever find anything?

POLICEMAN: No.

(Policeman hands Jerry his copy of the report.)

JERRY: Well, thanks anyway.

POLICEMAN: You bet.

(Policeman leaves the apartment, while George enters.)

ELAINE: I didn’t get that joke either.

JERRY: The crook has the machine. The messages aren’t for him. He’s the crook. Why would he answer- (Jerry gives up on the explanation and turns around to see George standing behind him.) How did you get in here?

(George slaps his right hand on his left elbow, and vice versa, acting like a genie.)

GEORGE : I walked in, your lobby door is broken again.

JERRY: Again?

GEORGE: I don’t know how you put up with this.

ELAINE: Yeah, tell ‘im George.

JERRY: (to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?

ELAINE: Yes! You don’t understand. I’m living with Ethel Merman without the talent.

JERRY: (to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?

(George shows him the keys.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, it’s very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, “Call the police. You really should call the police.” So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, “Yeah, I’m calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... I’m gonna see some real action.” Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out: The Report. They give you: Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I don’t really think we’re gonna crack this case, do you? It’s not like Batman, where there’s three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. “Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, he’s dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, he’s a PENGUIN!



INT. THE APARTMENT ON 83RD STREET – DAY

(George, Elaine and Jerry are entering the apartment.)

ELAINE: Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?

(Elaine takes a closer look at the fireplace.)

GEORGE: I didn’t know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, that's incredible.

JERRY: How do you get all that wood in here?

ELAINE: They deliver it.

JERRY: They deliver wood?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: What do you tip a wood guy?

(George looks intensively at the apartment description.)

GEORGE: I didn’t know there was a fireplace.

ELAINE: Look! Look at- look at this! There’s a garden.

GEORGE: A garden! I can’t believe there’s a garden!

JERRY: Would I have to get a gardener?

ELAINE: Yeah, you can get a gardener.

JERRY: You tip him?

ELAINE: You can.

GEORGE: (to Elaine) You don’t tip a gardener!

ELAINE: You can tip a gardener.

GEORGE: You don’t need a gardener.

ELAINE: Jerry, you can barbecue back here.

JERRY: They deliver the coal?

ELAINE: Sure, it’s...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.

JERRY: Oh, then I gotta tip him.

ELAINE: Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!

JERRY: I don’t have any plants.

GEORGE: I have plants. (snorts)

ELAINE: Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! I’m walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) It’s a walk-in. Can you believe it? I’m nuts about this, what do you think?

(Jerry closes the door, with Elaine still in it.)

JERRY: I like that. (He opens the closet. Elaine walks out with an angry look.) What do you think, George?

GEORGE: It’s your decision.

(Jerry walks around with Elaine walking next to him, copying his every move. Suddenly Jerry stops walking. Elaine is not able to copy this move; they look at each other, laughing.)

JERRY: I’m takin’ it, I’m takin’ the place. I’m gonna take it, this is gonna be my new place. I’m livin’ here...I’m movin’.

ELAINE: (laughing with joy) Your movin’? That means I’m movin’. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isn’t that incredible!

GEORGE: (unenthusiastic) Congratulations.
 


INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry and Elaine are there.)

ELAINE: What about the couch?

JERRY: You like the couch? I’ll tell you what I’m gonna do.

ELAINE: What?

JERRY: You’re movin’ in, you’re a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I don’t even wanna see it, go, get it out.

ELAINE: A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?

JERRY: Yeah!

ELAINE: For this couch?!

(Jerry shuts the apartment door.)

JERRY: Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?

ELAINE: Okay, uh, I’ll tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I don’t know, maybe...twenty dollars?

(Jerry looks at her as if to say, “You can’t be serious.” The apartment buzzer goes off. Jerry speaks over the intercom.)

JERRY: Yeah?

GEORGE: (from the intercom) Yeah, it’s George.

JERRY: Come on up. (Jerry presses the second button and opens the apartment door. He walks back to the couch.) Oh, all right, forget it, I’m gonna take it with me now... (He picks up the cushions.) I’m just gonna pack up the cushions right now...

ELAINE: Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.

JERRY: (continuing unphased) You wanna get the other end, ‘cause I wanna get it in the hall.

(He is about to lift up the couch.)

ELAINE: Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?

JERRY: Fifty dollars?

ELAINE: Uh-huh.

JERRY: Thank you very much.

ELAINE: Thank you very much.

(George enters and closes the door.)

GEORGE: Hey, what’s goin’ on?

ELAINE: I just bought Jerry’s couch for fifty dollars.

JERRY: (to George) So did you bring the lease? (George takes the lease from his inside pocket and hands it to Jerry.) All right, gee, three years, that kinda seems like a long time.

GEORGE: (frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.

JERRY: Why?

GEORGE: If you’re having second thoughts, if you didn’t want it, don’t worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.

JERRY: You could take it? You want it?

GEORGE: No, I don’t want it. I want it, if you don’t want it.

JERRY: So you do want it.

GEORGE: No I, I want it if you don’t want it.

JERRY: You just said you wanted it!

GEORGE: No, I’m saying, if a situation arose in which you didn’t want it, I might take it.

(Jerry picks up the lease and hands it to George.)

JERRY: So take it.

GEORGE: How can I take it?

JERRY: How can I take it?

GEORGE: It’s your apartment!

JERRY: How can I want it now, if you want it?

ELAINE: Excuse me, uh, I don’t mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?

GEORGE: Yes, but I am not taking it.

JERRY: I...am not taking it.

(He drops the lease demonstratively on his line.)

ELAINE: Well, one of you better damn well take it!

JERRY: Well, whaddaya wanna do here?

GEORGE: I, I don’t know.

JERRY: Do you wanna flip a coin?

GEORGE: Who flips? You’ll flip, I’ll call.

JERRY: Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and that’s it. Agreed?

GEORGE: I’m good.

ELAINE: I don’t know, who to root for, George’s place has carpeting.

(George "shushes" Elaine)

JERRY: All right, now you call it in the air.

GEORGE: No catchin’.

JERRY: No no.

GEORGE: Flip it.

(Jerry flips the coin.)

GEORGE: Heads!

(The coin hits the table. It falls on the floor. They all look intently at the coin.)

JERRY: Tails!

GEORGE: No, it hit the table, it hit the table.

JERRY: So what?

GEORGE: Interference! You can’t count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.

JERRY: You didn’t call no interference!

GEORGE: You don’t have to call that! That’s a rule!

JERRY: I don’t believe this.

GEORGE: Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!

JERRY: I don’t wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do you think?

ELAINE: I’d better not.

JERRY: Well, I’ll tell you what. I’ll choose you for it. Straight choose, three takes it, no disputes...that’s it, you gotta win three.

GEORGE: Okay. (They walk around each other.) OK. I’ll choose you. Whaddaya want?

JERRY: Odds.

GEORGE: I want evens.

JERRY: Good.

GEORGE: You got odds.

JERRY: You got evens.

GEORGE: Right, ready?

JERRY: For the apartment.

(They take their choose positions.)

BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!

JERRY: Mine!

BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!

JERRY: Mine!

(George walks to the table to take a break. They resume their positions.)

BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!

GEORGE: Mine!

BOTH: Once, twice, three, shoot!

(Jerry wins. Elaine starts measuring up Jerry’s couch.)

GEORGE: Congratulations...congratulations.

JERRY: Thanks.

GEORGE: I'm just gonna...wash. (George walks to the bathroom; screaming) WHY DID I PUT UP TWO? WHY DID I PUT UP TWO?

(Kramer slides into the apartment.)

KRAMER: Jerry, I think I’m on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: The last couple a days he’s been acting very strange. I think he’s avoiding me.

JERRY: Hard to imagine.

KRAMER: Yeah! And get this: I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, “Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.”

KRAMER: ..you know, very casually,

JERRY: Right.

KRAMER: (cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.

ELAINE: So what did he say?

KRAMER: “What stuff?”

JERRY: Ooh, (to Elaine) case closed!

KRAMER: No, you don’t understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, I’m gonna go over there, I’m gonna borrow some tea. If I don’t get back in five minutes, maybe you’d better call the police.

JERRY: Okay, starting...NOW!

(Jerry looks at his watch.)

KRAMER: Yeah!

(Kramer darts off.)

 

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: One of the problems in life is that when you’re a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, “I got the front seat” “I wanted the front seat!” “I called it”. And the other kid knows he’s got nothing to say: “He called it. What can I do?” If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. “Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat” And the judge would go, “Did he call it?” “Well no, he didn’t call-” BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) “He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.”



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry is sitting at a table, George returns from the bathroom.)

GEORGE: I love the mirror in that bathroom! I don’t know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I don’t know if it’s the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.

JERRY: It’s a good mirror. (They look at their menus.) So, what are you gettin’?

GEORGE: I don’t know, I can’t eat. You, you can’t have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs: out. Coffee: out. French fries: out. BLT: out! I go to visit my grandparents: three big brisket sandwiches, I’m sittin’ here with a carrot! They’re closing in on a hundred, I’m sayin’ to them, “How can you eat that stuff?” (They look at their menus again.) I’m so sick about losin’ that choose, you don’t know.

JERRY: All right, forget it, forget it. I’m not taking the place!

GEORGE: What?!

JERRY: How can I live there?

GEORGE: Why not?!

JERRY: Look at you, you’re still thinking about it. I’ll never feel comfortable.

GEORGE: Oh, get outta here.

JERRY: How can I ever have you over? You’ll sit there moping.

GEORGE: I won’t mope.

JERRY: You’re already moping! Would you take the place?

GEORGE: No, impossible! It’s your apartment.

JERRY: You found the place.

GEORGE: You won the choose.

JERRY: All right, forget it, it’s over, I’m not moving.

GEORGE: Well, me neither.

JERRY: Definitely?

GEORGE: Definitely.

JERRY: Alright, then just get rid of it. You won’t have any problem.

GEORGE: No, it’s not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment this afternoon.

(A waitress, Carol, approaches.)

CAROL: What apartment?

GEORGE: Oh, it’s a great place, it’s uh two-bedroom uh, west 83rd ‘bout half block from the park.

CAROL: What’s the rent?



INT. THE APARTMENT ON 83RD STREET – DAY

(The housewarming party for Carol, the waitress. Jerry, Elaine and George are invited to the house, they’re sitting on a couch, all three moping.)

GEORGE: I don’t know, what we’re doin’ here, this is ridiculous.

JERRY: She wanted to thank us for the apartment.

ELAINE: I can’t believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.

(She slaps Jerry on the leg.)

JERRY: If only the coin hadn’t hit the table.

GEORGE: The table is interference, you know it!

JERRY: It is not!

GEORGE: It is too!

ELAINE: My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on “Carousel”.

(Carol approaches them.)

CAROL: Hi.

GEORGE: Hi, Carol.

CAROL: I just wanted to introduce you to my husband, this is Larry.

(Jerry, Elaine and George get up. )

CAROL: This is George, Elaine and Jerry. These are the guys who got us the apartment.

LARRY: Oh, you don’t know how grateful I am, if there’s anything I can ever do to repay you, I, I mean, we’re just so thrilled with this place.

CAROL: It’s a dream.

LARRY: I’m running in the park now, I’ve lost weight, we’re barbecuing every night and the rent is unbelievable.

GEORGE: We’re really glad for you.

ELAINE: Couldn’t be happier.

JERRY: It’s wonderful.

(They sit down again.)

CAROL: Diane, Diane, come here.

(Diane comes to the couch. She is very attractive.)

CAROL: This is my new next door neighbour, Diane.

(Jerry, Elaine and George get up.)

CAROL: (to Diane) These are the guys, who turned this place down, can you believe it? (to Jerry, George and Elaine) Diane gave me the greatest backrub today. She’s a masseuse!

DIANE: How, how could you guys have turned this place down, it’s such a great location and it’s...so close to the park.

GEORGE: We’re aware of the proximity to the park, yes.

DIANE: Well, it was nice to meet you.

(Diane walks away.)

GEORGE: Nice meeting you.

(George shakes Carol’s hand. The three sit down again. Carol walks away.)

JERRY: How late are the stores open? I’m thinking of maybe uh, buying a new TV and smash it over my head.

(Two men are standing behind the couch, talking.)

MAN #1: I get a call from Gilmour this morning, and get this: they’re restructuring the organization in Atlanta and I gotta be there on the first of the month.

MAN #2: Really? What are you gonna ‘bout the apartment?

MAN #1: Well, what can I do? Give it up.

JERRY, GEORGE & ELAINE: What’s the rent?

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guy’s out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, it’s true, men hear a drill, it’s like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, “Honey, I think Jim’s working on something over there.” So they run over to the guy. Now they don’t actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. That’s what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, “What are you using, a Phillips-head?” You know, we feel involved. That’s why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, that’s just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they don’t cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. “What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, that’ll hold.”



INT. JERRY’S LOBBY – DAY

(Jerry and George are waiting for the elevator.)

GEORGE: I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.

JERRY: I don’t think you did anything wrong.

GEORGE: I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I don’t tell you.

JERRY: We can only thank God for that.

(Elevator opens. They get on.)

GEORGE: I’m outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) It’s only a matter of time now.

JERRY: You’re imagining this. Really.

GEORGE: Oh, no. No no no no.

(Elevator doors close.)



INT. ELEVATOR – CONTINUING

GEORGE: I’ll tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.

JERRY: What floss? When?

GEORGE: We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; there’s this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.

JERRY: Ah, mint.

GEORGE: Of course. So, I’m looking at it. I look up, I see she’s looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..

(Elevator doors open. They get off.)

JERRY: So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.

GEORGE: If I didn’t put that floss in my pocket, I’d be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.

(They approach Jerry’s apartment.)

JERRY: And you’re sure the floss was the catalyst?

GEORGE: Yes, I am.

JERRY: You don’t think it might’ve had anything to do with that?

(Jerry points to George’s fanny pack.)

GEORGE: What? You don’t like this?

JERRY: It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.

(They enter Jerry’s apartment)



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – CONTINUING

(Kramer is on the couch, talking on the phone.)

KRAMER: (to the phone) Oh, they’ve got a cure for cancer. See, it’s all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.

(Kramer hands the phone to Jerry.)

JERRY: (to Kramer) Who is it?

KRAMER: Take it.

JERRY: Who is it?

KRAMER: It’s for you.

JERRY: (to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesn’t know anything. He’s just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. I’m meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesday’s okay... All right. Uh, I’m a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.

KRAMER: Well, it’s your phone. He wanted to talk to you.

JERRY: Maybe I didn’t want to talk to him.

KRAMER: Well, why not?

JERRY: He bothers me. I don’t even answer the phone anymore because of him. He’s turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.

GEORGE: What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? We’re not going?

JERRY: We’re going. That’s next Wednesday.

GEORGE: Oh. Who is this guy?

JERRY: His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I would’ve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. He’s so self-involved.

(Kramer’s cordless phone rings. Kramer pulls it out of his pocket.)

KRAMER: That’s for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...

JERRY: Can you conduct your business elsewhere?

KRAMER: (ignoring Jerry) No no no. I’m talking about a whole chain of ‘em. Yeah.

(Kramer leaves Jerry’s apartment while still on the phone.)

GEORGE: I don’t know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, I’ll tell you that.

JERRY: I don’t bother with him. He’s been calling me for seven years. I’ve never called him once! He’s got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if he’s paying attention.

GEORGE: I don’t understand why you spend time with this guy.

JERRY: What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, “I don’t think we’re right for each other.” He’s a guy! At least with a woman, there’s a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.

GEORGE: No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.

JERRY: Just break up with him?

GEORGE: Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.

JERRY: The Truth.

(They both careen)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing)

JERRY: As a guy I don’t know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I don’t know how to say, “Bill, I feel I need to see other men.” Do you know what I mean? There’s nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think that’s the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because they’re two guys. That’s almost all we need to have in common. ‘Cause sports – sports and women – is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, “So, what’s in the refrigerator?”



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry and Joel are sitting at a table.)

JOEL: ...so my shrink wants me to bring my mother in for a session. This guy is a brilliant man. Lenny Bruce used to go to him. And I think, uh, Geraldo.

JERRY: You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-

JOEL: (to the counter of the restaurant) Hey hey hey hey, we’re starving here! We’ve been waiting here for ten minutes already!

JERRY: (testing Joel) So, I’m thinking about going to Iran this summer.

JOEL: I have to eat! I mean, I’m hypoglycemic.

JERRY: Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, it’s their annual terrorist luncheon.

JOEL: Yeah.

JERRY: (cont'd) I’m gonna do it in Farsi.

JOEL: Do you think I need a haircut?

(A waitress approaches their table.)

CLAIRE: Are you ready?

JERRY: Yeah, I’ll have the egg salad on whole wheat.

JOEL: (to the waitress) Let me ask you a question. This, uh, this turkey sandwich here, is that real turkey, or is it a turkey roll? I don’t want that processed turkey. (to Jerry) I hate it.

WAITRESS: I think it’s real turkey.

JOEL: Is there a real bird in the back?

WAITRESS: No, there’s not bird but-

JOEL: Well, how do you know for sure? Look, why don’t you do me a favor. Why don’t you go in the back and find out, okay? (The waitress leaves.) Unbelievable.

JERRY: How can you talk to someone like that?

JOEL: What are you saying? What, you like turkey roll?

JERRY: Listen, Joel. There’s something I have to tell you...

JOEL: (laughing) Wait, you’ll never guess who I ran into.

(Joel pushes out his ears as a hint to Jerry.)

JERRY AND JOEL: Howard Metro.

JOEL: He asked me if I still saw you. I said, “Sure, I see him all the time. We’re still great friends.” Anyway, Howard says hello. (laughs)

JERRY: Listen, Joel, I don’t think we should see each other anymore.

JOEL: What?

JERRY: This friendship: It’s not working.

JOEL: Not working? What are you talking about?

JERRY: We’re just not suited to be friends.

JOEL: How can you say that?

JERRY: Look, you’re a nice guy, it’s just that... we don’t have anything in common.

JOEL: (starting to cry) Wai-Wait. What did I do? Tell me. I want to know what I did.

JERRY: Y-You didn’t do anything. It’s not you, it’s me. It’s- this is very difficult.

JOEL: Look, I know I call you too much, right? I mean, I know you’re a very busy guy.

JERRY: No, it’s not that.

JOEL: (crying) You’re one of the few people I can talk to.

JERRY: Oh, come on. That’s not true.

JOEL: I always tell everybody about you. Tell everybody to (to the rest of the coffee shop) GO SEE HIS SHOW! (to Jerry) I mean, I’m your biggest fan!

JERRY: I know, I know.

JOEL: I mean, you’re my best friend.

JERRY: Best friend- I’ve never been to your apartment.

JOEL: I cannot believe that this is happening. I can’t believe it.

JERRY: Okay, okay. Forget it. It’s okay. I didn’t mean it.

JOEL: Didn’t mean what?

JERRY: What I said. I’ve been under a lot of stress.

JOEL: Oh, you’ve been under a lot of stress.

JERRY: Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it. I took it out on you. We’re still friends. We’re still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, I’ll tell you what. I’ve got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.

(Joel’s tears are clearing up.)

JOEL: Tonight?

JERRY: No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would’ve said tonight.

JOEL: Do you really want me to go?

JERRY: (lying) Yes.

JOEL: Okay. (Jerry gives him some napkins to clean himself up) Yeah, okay. Great! That would be, that’d be great. So, next Wednesday.

JERRY: Next Wednesday.

JOEL: Where is that waitress? (to the counter) Hey!



INT. BANK – DAY

(Jerry is at the counter, filling out a slip. George is carrying a jug full of change.)

GEORGE: ...she calls me up at my office

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: (cont'd) she says, “We have to talk.”

JERRY: Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.

GEORGE: That, or “Who’s bra is this?”

JERRY: That is worse.

GEORGE: So we order lunch, and we’re talking. Finally, she blurts out how it’s ‘not working’.

JERRY: Really.

GEORGE: So, I’m thinking, as she’s saying this, I’m thinking: great, the relationship’s over. But the egg salad’s on the way. So now I have a decision: Do I walk or do I eat?

JERRY: Hm. You ate.

GEORGE: We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.

JERRY: Someone says, “Get out of my life,” and that doesn’t affect your appetite?

GEORGE: Have you ever had their egg salad?

JERRY: It is unbelievable.

GEORGE: It’s unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didn’t even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.

(Jerry looks at George’s jug of change.)

JERRY: How much could you possibly have in there?

GEORGE: It’s my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.

JERRY: Yeah? Where’d he go, to an arcade?

GEORGE: (sarcastically) That’s funny. You’re a funny guy.

JERRY: C’mon, move up.

(George moves up in the bank line. There’s a customer in front of him.)

CUSTOMER: Oh great, Ewing’s hurt.

GEORGE: Ewing’s hurt? How long is he going to be out?

CUSTOMER: A couple of days at the most but...

GEORGE: Geez.

JERRY: Oh, God.

GEORGE: I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.

JERRY: Listen, George, little problem with the game.

GEORGE: What about it?

JERRY: The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..

GEORGE: What?

JERRY: I gave your ticket to Horneck.

GEORGE: (not believing him) You what?!

JERRY: Yeah, I’m sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.

GEORGE: No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?

JERRY: C’mon, c’mon, go ahead, move up.

GEORGE: Why did you give him my ticket for?

JERRY: You didn’t see him. It was horrible.

GEORGE: Oh, c’mon, Jerry. I can’t believe this.

JERRY: I had to do it.

(George is up to the teller. Jerry goes to another one.)

GEORGE: Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?

TELLER: I’m sorry, sir. We can’t do that.

JERRY: Do you want to go with him? You go. I don’t mind.

GEORGE: I’m not going with him. I don’t even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.

TELLER: Look, I can give you these and you can roll them yourself.

GEORGE: You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!



INT. COMEDY CLUB

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: No, I do not like the bank. I’ve heard the expression “Laughing all the way to the bank.” I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when there’s nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, it’s empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) “Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? I’m almost at the front. I’d like a reward for this please.”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(George is stuffing pennies into rolls.)

GEORGE: ...thirty-two, thirty-three-

JERRY: George.

(George puts up his hand.)

GEORGE: Not now.

(George counts to himself.)

JERRY: Could you stop the counting?

(George loses count.)

GEORGE: Nnnnnnngaaa!

(He dumps out roll.)

GEORGE: What?!

JERRY: Can I make it up to you? I’ll give you fifty bucks for the jug.

GEORGE: Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.

JERRY: Well, then I’m not going to the game either. Okay? I’ll give him both tickets.

GEORGE: Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!

JERRY: I- no, I don’t want to go.

GEORGE: He was really crying?

JERRY: I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and I’ll just make up some excuse why I can’t go to the game either.

GEORGE: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you’re going to lie to the guy, why don’t you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?

JERRY: George, the man wept.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Oh, hey guys. Man, I’m telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.

GEORGE: This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?

KRAMER: Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.

GEORGE: You know, you have to know how to do that. You can’t have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!

KRAMER: It’s all supervised.

GEORGE: Oh, well...

KRAMER: All of it. You want to invest?

GEORGE: My money’s all tied up in change right now.

KRAMER: No, I’m tellin’ you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.

JERRY: I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I can’t imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but that’s me. Alright

KRAMER: That’s you.

JERRY: I’m just saying..Alright.

KRAMER: Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you guys.

JERRY: Okay.

KRAMER: You know, this business is going to be big. I just wanted- okay.

(Kramer exits quickly, then sticks his head back through the door.)

KRAMER: One day, you’ll beg me to make your own pie.

(Kramer exits for good. Jerry dials Joel’s number.)

JERRY: (to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I can’t make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, he’s got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. They’re at the Will-Call window... And I’m really sorry... Have a good time... We’ll talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I don’t... Fine.. Fine... Bye.

(He hangs up.)

GEORGE: Trapezoid?

JERRY: I know. I’m really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Elaine and Jerry are there.)

ELAINE: Come on, let’s go do something. I don’t wanna just sit around here.

JERRY: Okay.

ELAINE: Want to go get something to eat?

JERRY: Where do you want to go?

ELAINE: I don’t care, I’m not hungry.

JERRY: We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.

ELAINE: What are we gonna do there? Talk?

JERRY: We could talk.

ELAINE: I’ll go if I don’t have to talk.

JERRY: Then we’ll just sit there.

ELAINE: Okay. I’m gonna check my machine first. (Elaine sees a pad of paper by the phone; reading) Picking someone up at the airport, jury duty, waiting for cable guy...

JERRY: Okay, just hand that over, please.

ELAINE: Oh, what is this?

JERRY: It’s a list of excuses, it’s for that guy, Horneck, who’s at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I don’t have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?

ELAINE: I got some for you.

JERRY: I don’t need any more.

ELAINE: No no no no no, these are good. Listen, listen: You ran out of underwear, you can’t leave the house.

JERRY: (not amused) Very funny.

ELAINE: How about: You’ve been diagnosed as a multiple personality. You’re not even you. You’re Dan.

JERRY: I’m Dan. Can I have my list back, please?

(Elaine gives Jerry the list.)

ELAINE: Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot believe you’re doing this. This is absolutely infantile.

JERRY: What can I do?

ELAINE: Deal with it. Be a man!

JERRY: Oh no. That’s impossible. I’d rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.

ELAINE: You made a man cry? I’ve never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn’t cry. I got the cab.

JERRY: Couple of tough monkeys.

(Elaine laughs. Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!

JERRY: Game?

KRAMER: Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!

JERRY: Wait. How does Horneck know you?

KRAMER: Last week. When I, you know, gave you the phone. He’s really into my pizza place idea!

JERRY: This is too much.

ELAINE: Wait, what pizza place idea?

JERRY: Oh, no.

KRAMER: You get to make your own pie!

ELAINE: Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.

KRAMER: Yea.

JOEL: (from the hallway) Kramer.

KRAMER: Yeah.

JERRY: Perfect.

(Joel enters.)

JOEL: Hey.

KRAMER: Okay, who wants meatloaf?

JERRY & ELAINE: No thanks.

KRAMER: (to Joel) It’s gonna be hot in a minute.

(Kramer exits.)

JOEL: So, I though you were tutoring your nephew?

JERRY: Oh, we finished early.

JOEL: M-hm, I’ll bet. So, are you going to introduce me to your ‘nephew’?

(Elaine laughs)

JERRY: Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.

ELAINE: Hi.

JOEL: Whoa, Nelson! This is Elaine? I though you guys split?

JERRY: We’re still friends.

JOEL: So, thanks again for those tickets. But next week, I’m going to take you. How about next Tuesday night? (to Elaine) And why don’t you come along?

ELAINE: Oh, no no. Tuesday’s uh no good becasue we’ve got choir practice.

JERRY: Right. I forgot about choir.

ELAINE: We-We’re doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.

JERRY: Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.

JOEL: What about Thursday night? I mean they’re playing the Sonics.

(Jerry shakes his head.)

ELAINE: Huh... Thursday is no good because we’ve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.

JOEL: You know, I should really try something like that.

JERRY: You really should.

JOEL: Well, let’s just take a look here.

(Horneck looks at his schedule.)

JOEL: Forty-one home games. Let's see saturday night we’ve got the Mavericks. If you don’t like the Mavericks, next Tuesday: Lakers. I mean, you gotta like Magic, right? Let’s see, on the road, on the road, on the road, on the road, back on the fourteenth. They play the Bulls. You can’t miss Air Jordan...



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: You know, I really... I’ve come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that they’re just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you don’t really wanna see them. You don’t call them, they call you. You don’t call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you don’t really have anything in common with is to pretend you’re hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend there’s a little desk around you. The only problem with this is there’s no way you can say, “Hey, it’s been great having you on the show. We’re out of time.”

INT. COMEDY CLUB

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because money’s a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you don’t care about money when you’re hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, you’re like the ruler of an empire. “More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives.” Then after the meal, you know, you’ve got the pants open, you’ve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. They’re mystified by the check. “What is this? How could this be?” They start passing it around the table, “Does this look right to you? We’re not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?”



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry and George sit at a booth.)

JERRY: I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor.

GEORGE: I never heard him say anything really funny.

JERRY: But it’s common sense. He’s got super strength, super speed. I’m sure he’s got super humor.

GEORGE: You would think that, but either you’re born with a sense of humor, or you’re not. It’s not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.

JERRY: Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected by the yellow sun of Earth?

GEORGE: I don’t know. But he ain’t funny.

(Elaine joins them. The boys check their watches.)

ELAINE: I know, I know. I’m sorry I’m late.

JERRY: No problem.

ELAINE: I dropped a grape.

GEORGE: Pardon?

ELAINE: I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldn’t find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.

JERRY: Were you crying? I mean, it’s just a grape. You’ll find it.

ELAINE: No, I’m just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I’m going out with...

JERRY: Robert.

ELAINE: Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and I’m allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can’t even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actor’s studio so we can’t go there. It’s really causing a lot of problems, you know. He won’t even go away for the weekend because of these cats.

GEORGE: Guys with cats... I don’t know.

JERRY: I’ve been thinking about asking this girl I’m, uh, seeing-

ELAINE: Vanessa.

JERRY: Vanessa, thank you. I’ve been thinking about asking her to go away for a couple of days.

GEORGE: Oh, no. No no no no no. I’d have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Let’s see, you’re going to be with her seventy-two hours. That’s a dating decathlon.

ELAINE: (balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why don’t you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. She’ll love it.

GEORGE: That’s exquisite. Listen, uh, if it’s not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?

(Elaine gets the paper, and George starts flipping through it.)

JERRY: You better find that grape before it mutates into another life form. There was once a mutant grape that terrorized an entire town in the Texas panhandle. They brought in the army, nobody could stop it. Apparently it had a pit of steel.

(Elaine gives Jerry a look)

GEORGE: Up again?! This is incredible! I’m.. I’m getting it.

ELAINE: You’re getting what?

GEORGE: A stock.

JERRY: What stock?

GEORGE: Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?

JERRY: Maybe.

GEORGE: He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now he’s got some new thing. You know, there’s supposed to be a big merger. He wasn’t even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.

JERRY: How high’s it suppose to go?

GEORGE: I don’t know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?

JERRY: Boy... I don’t know.

ELAINE: I’d do it but I don’t have any money.

JERRY: What kind of company is it?

GEORGE: It’s called Sendrax. They’ve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.

ELAINE: Televising opera?

GEORGE: Some sort of electronic thingy.

JERRY: Well, how much are you going to invest?

GEORGE: Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.

JERRY: Boy...

GEORGE: C’mon. Wilkinson’s got millions invested in this stock. It’s gone up three points since I’ve been watching it.

JERRY: What if I lose it?

GEORGE: C’mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We’ll do it together. Come on, come on. We’re in it together.

JERRY: All right. Twenty-five hundred.

GEORGE: That’s it.

(The waitress arrives.)

WAITRESS: Yeah, can I take your order?

GEORGE: (Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.

JERRY: My bet? All right. I’ll open with a tuna sandwich.

ELAINE: Tuna?

JERRY: Oh, the dolphin thing?

ELAINE: They’re dying in the nets.

JERRY: Ohhh... You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on tuna.

ELAINE: Jerry, can’t you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?

JERRY: Hey, when I’m driving, I let people in ahead of me all the time. I’m always waving everybody in. “Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.” ...All right. All right. I’ll have a chicken salad.

ELAINE: And I’m going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.

WAITRESS: Okay. (To George) What about you?

GEORGE: I’ll have the tuna.



INT. SUPERMARKET – NIGHT

(Jerry and Vanessa are on a date.)

JERRY: I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.

VANESSA: Why didn’t you do something?

JERRY: What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, I’m risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?

STOCK BOY: No puffs. Just flakes.

JERRY : Have you thought any more about that trip?

VANESSA: Yeah, I’ve been thinking about it.

JERRY: You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.

VANESSA: I don’t know. I just worry about trips like this. It’s a lot of pressure.

JERRY: It’s great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It’s like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.

VANESSA: Oh, so you want to move our relationship into Phase Two?

JERRY: Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.

VANESSA: Really? Could we go fishing up there?

JERRY: Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?

VANESSA: They have marlin in Vermont?

JERRY: Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)

(Jerry picks up a newspaper.)

VANESSA: Jerry, the stock is the same as when you checked it earlier. There are no changes after the market closes. The stock is still down.

JERRY : I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they have, uh, different... sources.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry is looking at a road map. Kramer enters with a newspaper.)

JERRY: Is that my paper?

KRAMER: Bad news, my friend.

JERRY: What? What news?

KRAMER : Sendrax.

JERRY: Oh, c’mon! It’s down again?!

KRAMER: Two and a half points.

JERRY: Oh, I can’t believe it. Let me see that. (Jerry takes the paper.) That’s four and a half points in three days! That’s almost half my money!

KRAMER: Hey, I told you.

JERRY: (sarcastic) Yeah, you told me.

KRAMER: It’s all manipulated with junk bonds. You can’t win.

(Jerry picks up the reciever of his phone, and dials.)

JERRY: There’s one thing I don’t understand. Why does it please you? (to the phone) George Costanza, please.

KRAMER: Hey, I don’t care. I’m just telling you to (yelling) get rid of that stock, now!

JERRY: (to the phone) George, what’s going on?!

KRAMER: Sell it, just say I’m selling!

JERRY: (to the phone) Well, where is the guy?!... Nothing?! Almost half my money’s gone... Well, call me right back. (Jerry hangs up.) Nobody can reach Wilkinson. He hasn’t been home or in his office in the past three days!

KRAMER: You know, I can’t believe you put your money in that Sendrax. And you could’ve invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.

JERRY: Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?

KRAMER: Okay, you’re in a restaurant. You’ve got a very big meeting coming up...

JERRY: Okay...

KRAMER: (looks at his shirt as if he had a tie on) Oh man, you got mustard on your tie!

JERRY: (going along with it) Oh No!

KRAMER: You just (makes the tearing sound) tear it off, and vvvvrrrpppp you got a new one right here. Then you’re gone.

JERRY: You’re gone all right.

KRAMER: (Looking at map) Hey, where, where are you going? You gonna take a trip? The map... what...

JERRY: Yeah, I’m going to Vermont with uh Vanessa for a few days.

KRAMER: Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming over this weekend.

JERRY: What friends?

KRAMER: Well, it’s just some people I met at a rock concert. (Phone rings.) Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give Kramer a look.) ‘Cause they’re really good people, Jerry. I’m telling you. You know, they’re anarchists. They’re.. they’re.. they’re.. huge.

(Jerry answers the phone.)

JERRY: George- What?! You’re kidding... Well, what’s wrong?... So, what are we gonna do?... Great!... All right, I’ll speak to you later. (He hangs up.) Wilkinson, the guy who’s supposed to tell us when to sell the stock, he’s in the hospital.

(Kramer smiles.)



INT. DRY CLEANERS – DAY

(Jerry and George are in line. )

JERRY: So you don’t know what’s wrong with him?

GEORGE: All Simons was able to find out is that he’s in the hospital.

JERRY: Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?

GEORGE: Of course he’s been in touch with him. He’s left two messages. He just hasn’t heard back yet, that’s all.

JERRY: Well, this is it. I’m selling.

GEORGE: Just give it a little more time.

JERRY: I never should’ve gotten involved in this. I’m a nervous wreck. I’m not cut out for investing.

GEORGE: All right, all right. That’s it. I’m gonna go down there.

JERRY: Where?

GEORGE: To the hospital.

JERRY: The hospital?

GEORGE: I’m going to find out what’s going on. All right?

JERRY: Are you nuts? You don’t even know the guy.

GEORGE: So what? I’ll start talking to him, you know, casual, and I’ll work my way around to it.

JERRY: What if he’s in an iron lung or something? What are you gonna do? (Jerry knocks on imaginary glass.) “How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson?” (He makes a hissing sound.) “By the way, what’s happening with Sendrax?”

GEORGE: Maybe he’s resting.

JERRY: Who goes to the hospital to rest?

GEORGE: What are you, a doctor?

JERRY: Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?

GEORGE: Today. I’m going today. Just don’t do anything until you hear from me.

JERRY: All right.

(Jerry moves up in line; a woman takes his place. George does not notice.)

GEORGE: (to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.

(Woman gives him a look.)

DRY CLEANER: (to Jerry) May I help you?

JERRY: Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It’s completely shrunk. There’s absolutely no way I can wear it.

DRY CLEANER: When did you bring it in?

JERRY: What’s the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!

DRY CLEANER: You got a receipt?

JERRY: I can’t find the receipt.

DRY CLEANER: You should get the receipt.

JERRY: Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! It’s a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!

DRY CLEANER: Yes, but how do I know we did the shirt?

JERRY: What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I don’t even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. That’s what I want. I want an admission of guilt.

DRY CLEANER: Maybe you asked for it to be washed.

JERRY: No! Dry-cleaned.

DRY CLEANE: Let me explain to you something, okay? With certain types of fabrics, different chemicals can react, causing-

JERRY: You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!

DRY CLEANER: (looks around making sure not too many people are listening) I shrunk it.



INT. COMEDY CLUB - NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, “Well, it’s ruined.” And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, “It’s not our fault. We’re not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation.” You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? They’re cleaning our clothes, but they’re not getting anything wet. It’s all dry. I know there’s gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that they’re using. There’s no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) That’s dry cleaning. I don’t think that’s what they’re doing back there. They don’t have eighty guys going, “Come on, hurry up! There’s a lot of shirts today!”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry and Elaine are there. Elaine sneezes.)

JERRY: Bless you.

ELAINE: Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart, anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they’re clean? I am sorry. My Uncle Pete showers four times a day and he can’t count to ten, so don’t give me hygiene.

JERRY : So what are you gonna do?

ELAINE: I don’t know. I can’t think of any solution, unless of course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do you think a hit man would charge to rub out a couple of cats?

JERRY: Well, it couldn’t be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?

ELAINE: What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?

JERRY: I’m no cat killer.

ELAINE: How about we go over there right now and we shave them?

JERRY: I’d really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely go.

ELAINE: He actually went to the hospital?

JERRY: Yeah.

ELAINE: Oh man, he’s nuts.

JERRY: Yeah, he’s nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter Kramer, holding a paper up to Jerry.) I know, I know. It’s down again.

KRAMER: How much are you down altogether?

JERRY: I don’t know.. fifteen hundred dollars.

KRAMER: Wow.

JERRY: You don’t have to say “Wow.” I know it’s “Wow.” (Kramer smiling) And there’s that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) It’s George.

(Jerry presses the button to let George in. Elaine goes into the bathroom. Kramer picks up some binoculars and looks out the window.)

KRAMER: Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.

JERRY: I really don’t need to look.

KRAMER: What a body. Yeeaahh. That’s for me.

JERRY: Yeah, and you’re just what she’s looking for too – a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.

KRAMER: I’m gonna go down there and try and talk to her.

(Kramer exits. George enters and flops onto the couch.)

JERRY: What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you what’s gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?

GEORGE: Fifteen seconds.

JERRY: You told him you knew Simons?

GEORGE: Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, I’m in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I’ll tell you one thing. I don’t know what he’s got. But for a sick guy, he’s very strong.

(Elaine exits bathroom.)

JERRY: Well, that’s it. Look, I’m going to Vermont. I don’t want to think about this. I’m selling.

ELAINE: Didn’t work, huh?

GEORGE: (laughs) Not quite.

ELAINE: We-Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?

GEORGE: I’m keeping it. I’m going down with the ship.



INT. COUNTRY INN’S LOBBY - DAY

(Jerry and Vanessa are well into their weekend together. It’s raining outside.)

JERRY: So I know this guy. I’m getting all my sneakers at a discount now.

VANESSA: I know. You mentioned it.

JERRY: Oh yeah, right.

JERRY: (thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I’ve still got another day! I’ve got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) That’s a nice watch. Do you wind it?

VANESSA: No, it’s got a little battery.

JERRY: Well, that’s good.

JERRY: (thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. I’m speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I don’t care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?

VANESSA: No, it’s okay.

JERRY: So, I guess you don’t find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?

VANESSA: Not especially.

JERRY: Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?

VANESSA: What can we do? It’s raining.

JERRY: We cold play “Sorry!” We cold play “Steal the Old Man’s Bundle.” (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that you’re wearing?

VANESSA: Oh, you’ve never heard of it.

JERRY: No, what? What kind is it?

VANESSA: I can’t tell you.

JERRY: (thinking) Yeah, that’s normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?

VANESSA: That stock? I thought you got out of that?

JERRY: I did. I’m just curious. It’s been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) It’s up six points!

VANESSA: I told you not to sell.

JERRY: You did not tell me not to sell.

VANESSA: I said the market fluctuates. Remember?

JERRY: Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!

VANESSA: That’s probably why we're-

(She stops herself.)

JERRY: What?

VANESSA: Forget it.

JERRY: No, what? ‘That’s probably why..’

VANESSA: That’s probably why we’re staying here, because you lost money on the stock.

JERRY: (thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...



INT. MONK’S DINER – NIGHT

(Jerry, George and Elaine are there, having just eaten.)

GEORGE: (laughing) Have something else. C’mon, have a little dessert?

JERRY : I’m good, thanks.

GEORGE: Elaine, get something! It’s all taken care of.

ELAINE: I’m kinda full.

GEORGE: So don’t finish it.

JERRY: (acidly) She’s full. So, Big Daddy. I’m just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?

GEORGE: I don’t like to discuss figures.

JERRY: How much?

GEORGE: I don’t know, what? Eight thousand. It’s a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.

JERRY: So, Wilkinson’s out of the hospital now?

GEORGE : No. You’d be surprised. You don’t recover that quickly from a nose job.

(Elaine sneezes.)

ELAINE: Oh god.

JERRY: Is that still from the cats?

ELAINE: No, I just have a cold.

JERRY: So, what ever happened with that?

ELAINE: I gave him an ultimatum.

(Jerry looks at her. Elaine shrugs.)

GEORGE: He chose the cats?

ELAINE: They’re very clean animals.

JERRY: I gotta say, that’s pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.

ELAINE: Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.

GEORGE: I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you can’t get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. You’d get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...

ELAINE: Superman can go back in time?

JERRY: We went over that.

GEORGE: Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinson’s got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. They’re about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.

JERRY: A robot butcher?

GEORGE: Shhhhh. If you want to get in, there’s very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I’m not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. I’ve decided I’ll do the work. I’m gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? ‘Cause you send your money out there – working for you – a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, “What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me.” “Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.”

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I’m always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice. Never quite sure, “Is this the best lane for me? For my life?” They’re always a little bit ahead of you, “Can I get in over there? Could I get in over here? Could I get in there?” “Yeah, come on over here, pal. We’re zoomin’ over here. This is the secret lane, nobody knows about it.” The ultimate, I think the ultimate psychological test of traffic is the total dead stop. Not even rolling. And you look out the window, you can see gum clearly. So we know that in the future traffic will get even worse than that. I mean, what will happen? Will it start moving backwords, I wonder? I mean, is that possible? That someday we’ll be going, (Jerry pretends he’s driving in reverse.) “Boy, this is some really bad traffic now, boy. This, is really bad. I’m gonna try to get off and get back on going the other way.”



INT. JERRY’S CAR

(Jerry is in the driver’s seat, and George is in the passenger seat.)

GEORGE: She can’t kill me right?

JERRY: No, of course not.

GEORGE: People break up all the time.

JERRY: Everyday.

GEORGE: It just didn’t work out. What can I do? I wanted to love her. I tried to love her. I couldn’t.

JERRY: You tried.

GEORGE: I kept looking at her face. I’d go, “C’mon, love her. Love her!”

JERRY: Did you tell her you loved her?

GEORGE: Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She’d tell me she loved me. All right, at first, I just look at her. I’d go, “Oh, really? Or uh, Boy, that’s, that’s something.” But, eventually you have to come back with, “Well, I love you.” You know, you can only hold out for so long.”

JERRY: You’re a human being.

GEORGE: And I didn’t even ask her out. She asked me out first. She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? (laughs) I can’t do that to someone.

JERRY: You’re too nice a guy.

GEORGE: I am. I’m a nice guy. And she seduced me! We were in my apartment, I’m sitting on the couch, she’s on the chair. I get up to go to the bathroom, I come back, she’s on the couch. What am I supposed to do? Not do anything? I couldn’t do that. I would’ve insulted her.

JERRY: You’re flesh and blood.

GEORGE: I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends, I didn’t want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it would only get me in deeper. But they were everywhere! They kept popping up all over the place. “This is Nancy, this is Susan, this is Amy, this is my cousin, this is my brother, this is my father...” It’s like I’m in quicksand.

JERRY: I told you when I met her.

GEORGE: My back is killing me.

JERRY: You gotta go to my chiropractor, he’s the best.

GEORGE: Oh yeah, everybody’s guy is the best.

JERRY: I’m gonna make an appointment for you. We’ll go together.

GEORGE: Please. They don’t do anything. Look, do I have to break up with her in person? Can’t I do it over the phone? I-I have no stomach for these things.

JERRY: You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right off!

(Car door opens. It’s Elaine.)

ELAINE: Hi.

JERRY: Hi.

(George pulls his seat forward to allow Elaine into the back.)

ELAINE: Hey, what are you doing?

GEORGE: I’m letting you in.

ELAINE: Oh no. No. I don’t want to sit in the back. I’ll be left out of the conversation.

GEORGE: No, you won’t.

ELAINE: Yes, I will, George. I’ll have to stick my chin on top of the seat.

GEORGE: Okay.

(George gets out, and gestures for Elaine to sit in the middle.)

ELAINE: Why can’t you sit in the middle?

GEORGE: Please, it doesn’t look good. Boy, boy, girl.

ELAINE: You’re afraid to sit next to a man. You’re a little homophobic, aren’t ya?

GEORGE: Is it that obvious?

(Elaine sits in the middle.)

ELAINE: Hello, Jerry.

JERRY: Hello.

ELAINE: Did you get a haircut?

JERRY: No, shower. So, where are we eating?

ELAINE: Tell me if you think this is strange. There’s this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. He’s a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever we’d run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. He’s a nice guy, he’s got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, that’s where this relationship is finally gonna settle: polite nodding. Then one day, he doesn’t nod. Like I don’t exist?! He went from nods to nothing.

GEORGE: (singing; imitating Tony Bennett) “You know, I’d go from nods to nothing...”

ELAINE: And now, there’s this intense animosity whenever we pass. I mean, it’s like we really hate each other. It’s based on nothing.

JERRY: A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened in “The Blob”.

GEORGE: I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy. Confront him.

ELAINE: Really?

GEORGE: Yes.

ELAINE: You would do that?

GEORGE: If I was a different person.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry is on the phone.)

JERRY: Hello... Hello. Is Glen there?... I’m sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?... Yes, I know I have the wrong number, but I just want to know if I dialed wrong or if...

(The other guy hangs up on Jerry; he redials. Kramer enters. The intercom buzzes; Kramer answers it.)

KRAMER: (to the intercom) Come on up.

JERRY: (to the phone) Oh, it’s you again. See, now if you had answered me, I wouldn’t have had to do this. Now that’s two long distance calls I made to you why can’t you... (The guy hangs up on Jerry again; to nobody) Why? Why do they just hang up like that? Thank you very much.

(Kramer holds up some cantaloupe.)

KRAMER: Taste this.

JERRY: No, I just had a sandwich.

KRAMER: No, taste it. Taste it.

JERRY: I don’t want cantaloupe now.

KRAMER: You’ve never had cantaloupe like this before...

JERRY: I only eat cantaloupe at certain times...

KRAMER: ...Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.

JERRY: ...all right!

(Jerry tastes it.)

KRAMER: Uh-huh. It’s good?

JERRY: It’s very good.

KRAMER: Good, huh?

JERRY: Good.

KRAMER: I got it at Joe’s.

JERRY: Uh-huh.

KRAMER: Forty-nine cents a pound. That’s practically half than what you’re paying at the supermarket. I don’t know why you don’t go to Joe’s.

JERRY: It’s too far.

KRAMER: It’s three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..

JERRY: I’m not pulling a shopping cart. What, am I suppose to wear a kerchief? Put stockings on and roll ‘em down below my knee?

KRAMER: See, the other thing is, if you don’t like anything, he takes it right back.

JERRY: I don’t return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going in.

(Enter George. He dances around the room, singing the Zorba theme.)

GEORGE: I’m outta there. I did it! It’s over.

JERRY: You did it? What happened?

GEORGE: I told her. In the kitchen – which was risky ‘cause it’s near all the knives. I started with the word “Listen.”

JERRY: Uh-huh...

GEORGE: I said, “Listen Marlene,” and then the next thing I know, I’m in the middle of it. And there’s this voice inside of me going, “You’re doing it! You’re doing it!” And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, “Keep going, keep going. You’re almost out!” It’s like I was making a prison break, you know, and I’m heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. She’s firing at me from the guard tower. “Son of a bang! Son of a boom!” I get to the top of the wall – the front door. I opened it up, I’m one foot away, I took one last look around the penitentiary, and I jumped!

JERRY: See, it’s never as bad as you imagine.

KRAMER: I liked Marlene. What’s her number?

GEORGE: Uh, no, I, I don’t think so.

(Kramer is eating cantaloupe.)

JERRY: (to Kramer) Could you stop that smacking?

KRAMER: George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.

GEORGE: Oh no, thank you.

KRAMER: It’s the best cantaloupe I ever had.

GEORGE: No, really. No, no, thanks.

KRAMER: Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.

JERRY: It’s very good cantaloupe. (Kramer leaves; to George) So that’s it? You’re out?

GEORGE: Except for one small problem. Hah, I left some books in her apartment.

JERRY: So, go get them.

GEORGE: Oh, no no, I can’t go back there. Jerry, it’s so awkward and, you know, it could be dangerous sexually. Something could happen, I’d be right back where I started from.

JERRY: So forget about the books. Did you read them?

GEORGE: Well, yeah.

JERRY: What do you need them for?

GEORGE: I don’t know. They’re books.

JERRY: What is this obsession people have with books? They put them in their houses like they’re trophies. What do you need it for after you read it?

GEORGE: They’re my books.

JERRY: So you want me to get the books? Is that it?



INT. MONK’S DINER – NIGHT

(Jerry and Marlene are sitting at a booth. Marlene has a milkshake. A pile of books are on the table.)

MARLENE: ...so, it must’ve been ninety-five degrees that night, and everyone’s just standing around the pool with little drinks in their hands. I was wearing my old jeans and t-shirt. And I don’t know, I was just in one of those moods. So I said to myself, “Marlene, just do it.” And I jumped in. And as I’m getting out, I feel all these eyes on me, and I look up and everyone is just staring at me.

JERRY: So what’d you do?

MARLENE: Well, nothing. It’s no skin off my hide if people like to look. I just didn’t see what the big attraction was.

JERRY: Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a guess.

MARLENE: Hey, you know, Jerry, just because George and I don’t see each other anymore, it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t stay friends.

JERRY: No.

MARLENE: Good enough. I’m really glad we got that settled.



INT. CHIROPRACTOR’S WAITING ROOM – DAY

(Jerry and George are reading magazines.)

JERRY: I don’t know how this happened.

GEORGE: Jerry, it’s not my fault.

JERRY: No, no. It’s not your fault. “Books, books, I need my books.” Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great thing? When you read Moby Dick the second time, Ahab and the whale become good friends. You know, it’s not like Marlene’s a bad person or anything, but, my God! I mean, we’ve had like three lunches and a movie, and she never stops calling. (George nods.) And it’s these meaningless, purposeless, blather calls. She never asks if I’m busy or anything. I just pick up the phone, and she’s in the middle of a sentence!

GEORGE: It's standard. Has she left you one of those messages where she uses up the whole machine?

JERRY: (disgusted) Ohh! You know, and sometimes she’ll go, (imitates Marlene) “Hello, Jerry?” And I’ll go, “Oh, hi Marlene.” And then it’s “Jerry...”

JERRY & GEORGE: “I dunno sometimes...”

GEORGE: What trying to get off the phone?

JERRY: (more disgusted) Ohhhh! You can’t! It’s impossible! There’s no break in the conversation where you can go, “All right then...” You know, it just goes on and on and on without a break in the wall. I mean, I gotta put a stop to this.

GEORGE: Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion. Right off! (beat) She is sexy though. Don’t you think?

JERRY: Yeah. Yes, she is.

(The RECEPTIONIST enters.)

RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Costanza?

GEORGE: Yeah.

RECEPTIONIST: The doctor will see you now.

GEORGE: (to Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. I’m going to have to wait in that little room all by myself, aren’t I? (He picks up a crossword puzzle.) I better take this. I hate the little room. (George walks into the hallway that leads to the doctor’s office.) “Oh, hello, Doctor.”



INT. COMEDY CLUB

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: The waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room. ‘Cause it says “Waiting Room.” There’s no chance of not waiting. ‘Cause they call it the waiting room, they’re gonna use it. They’ve got it. It’s all set up for you to wait. And you sit there, you know, and you’ve got your little magazine. You pretend you’re reading it, but you’re really looking at the other people. You know, you’re thinking about about them. Things like, “I wonder what he’s got. As soon as she goes, I’m getting her magazine.” And then, they finally call you and it’s a very exciting moment. They finally call you, and you stand up and you kinda look around at the other people in the room. “Well, I guess I’ve been chosen. I’ll see you all later.” You know, so you think you’re going to see the doctor, but you’re not, are you? No. You’re going into the next waiting room – the littler waiting room. But if they are, you know, doing some sort of medical thing to you, you want to be in the smallest room that they have, I think. You don’t wnat to be in the largest room that they have. You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You don’t want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, “I have to see this! Are you kidding? Are they really gonna do that to him? Are there seats? Can we get in?” Do they scalp tickets to these things? “I got two for the Winslow tumor, I got two...”



INT. CHIROPRACTOR’S WAITING ROOM – DAY

(George returns from his appointment to meet Jerry.)

JERRY: So, how was it?

GEORGE: I was in there for two minutes. He didn’t do anything. Touch this, feel that – seventy-five bucks!

JERRY: Well, it’s a first visit.

GEORGE: What’s seventy-five bucks?! What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?! Am I being entertained? I don’t understand this. I’m only paying half.

JERRY: You can’t do that.

GEORGE: Why not?

JERRY: He’s a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.

GEORGE: Oh, no no no. I pay what I say.



INT. JERRY’S CAR – NIGHT

(Jerry is dropping off Marlene.)

MARLENE: Are you feeling weird?

JERRY: No, I’m fine.

MARLENE: Nothing really happened.

JERRY: Yeah, I know.

MARLENE: We just kissed a little. People kiss.

JERRY: Yeah.

MARLENE: Well... night.

(She leans over and kisses Jerry on the cheek. She exits the car. Jerry is stunned.)

JERRY: (belated) Good night.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Kramer enters with a golf club.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: I got it! This time, I got it!

JERRY : All right.

(Kramer sets up to show his golf swing.)

KRAMER: Hips! See, it’s all hips.

JERRY: Uh-huh.

KRAMER: You gotta come through with the hips first.

(He swings at an imaginary golf ball. Jerry looks off into the distance, at the ball.)

JERRY: That is out there.

(Kramer notices Jerry is eating cantaloupe; his eyes light up.)

KRAMER: Joe’s?

JERRY: No, supermarket.

KRAMER: Well, is it good?

JERRY: It’s uh okay.

KRAMER: Let me taste it.

(He takes a bite and immediately spits it out.)

KRAMER: See, that stinks. You can’t eat that. You should take that back.

JERRY: I’m not taking it back.

KRAMER: All right, I’ll take it back. I’m going by there.

JERRY: I don’t care about it.

KRAMER: Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be taken out of circulation.

JERRY: All right. Take it back.

(Jerry’s phone rings. He is reluctant to answer it. The machine picks up.)

JERRY’S MESSAGE: “Leave a message, I’ll call you back.”

MARLENE: (from the phone) Jerry, have you ever taken a bath in the dark? If I’m not talking into the soap right now, call me back.

KRAMER: Well?

JERRY: Marlene.

KRAMER: (smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene...

JERRY: Yeah, I took her home one night – we kinda started up a little bit in the car.

KRAMER: I thought you were trying to get rid of her?

JERRY: I was. But, she’s got me, like, hypnotized.

KRAMER: Does George know?

JERRY: No, he’d go nuts.

KRAMER: Yeah, no kidding.

JERRY: I feel terrible. (Kramer smiling) I mean, I’ve seen her a couple of times since then, and I know I can’t go any further, but... She’s just got this like, psychosexual hold over me. I just want her, I can’t breathe. It’s like a drug.

KRAMER: Whoa, psychosexual.

JERRY: I don’t know how I’m going to tell him.

KRAMER: Man, I don’t understand people. I mean, why would George want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?

JERRY: It’s partially you, yeah.

KRAMER: You’re his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesn’t even know?

JERRY: Well, he can’t kill me, right?

KRAMER: You’re a human being.

JERRY: I mean, she called me. I haven’t called her. She started it.

KRAMER: You’re flesh and blood.

JERRY: I’m a nice guy.

(Elaine enters, holding a desk lamp in the shape of an airplane.)

ELAINE: Hi.

(She hands Jerry the lamp.)

JERRY: (excited) Oh, my little airplane lamp.

ELAINE: You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city. That’s hard to get used to when you’re in so many other fast ones.

JERRY: Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the offices, because you don’t have to be home on time.

ELAINE: Unless you’re married to a dictator.

JERRY: Yeah... Because they would be very demanding people.

ELAINE: Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point somebody’s going to offer me some cantaloupe?

KRAMER: Nope. No good.

JERRY: Well, you know what they say. Lucky in love, Unlucky with fruit.

KRAMER: Well, I’m taking this back.

(Kramer exits.)

ELAINE: So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.

JERRY: Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?

ELAINE: Yes.

JERRY: You talked to him?

ELAINE: Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, “No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.”

JERRY: Right.

ELAINE: So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, “Hi, remember me?” And he furrows his brow, as if he’s really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, “You little phony. You know exactly who I am.”

JERRY: You said "you little phony"?

ELAINE: I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, “Oh, yeah. You’re Jeanette’s friend. We did meet once.” And I said, “Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?”

JERRY: This is amazing.

ELAINE: And he says, he says, “Look, I just didn’t want to say hello anymore, All right?” And I said, “Fine. Fine. I didn’t want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that I’m aware of it!”

(Elaine tastes some cantaloupe.)

JERRY: You are the Queen of Confrontation. You’re my new hero. In fact, you’ve inspired me. I’m gonna call George about something right now.

ELAINE: This cantaloupe stinks.

(She spits it out in a napkin.)



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Jerry and George sit at a table for two.)

GEORGE: (considers for a second) I don’t care.

JERRY: You’re kidding.

GEORGE: No, I don’t care.

JERRY: You mean that?

GEORGE: Absolutely.

JERRY: You don’t care?

GEORGE: No.

JERRY: How could you not care?

GEORGE: I don’t know. But I don’t. I’m actually almost happy to hear it.

JERRY: I thought you’d be upset.

GEORGE: I guess I should be, but I’m not.

JERRY: Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?

GEORGE: You’re a fine person. You’re a humanitarian. She’s very sexy.

JERRY: That voice. That voice. She’s driving me crazy.

GEORGE: I know. I know.

JERRY: So I can see her tonight, and you don’t care?

GEORGE: See her tonight. See her tomorrow. Go. Knock yourself out. She’s too crazy for me.

JERRY: All right. As long as you’re okay. Because I can’t stop thinking about her.

GEORGE: I’m okay. I’m fine. I’m wonderful. I never felt better in my whole life.

JERRY: Good. And I’ll tell you what... You don’t have to pay me back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of your bill.

GEORGE: (shocked and angry) You paid that crook?!

JERRY: I had to.

GEORGE: He didn’t do anything, Jerry. It’s a scam! Who told you to do that?

JERRY: It was embarrassing to me.

GEORGE: Oh, I was trying to make a point.

JERRY: Why don’t you make a point with your own doctor? (George gulps.) What’s wrong?

GEORGE: (gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! I swallowed a fly! What do I do? (He turns to a coffee shop patron at the counter.) What can happen?!



INT. JERRY’S CAR – NIGHT

(Jerry and Marlene are parked outside Jerry’s building.)

JERRY: So, you wanna come up for a few minutes?

MARLENE: I’m sorry, Jerry. I just don’t think this is gonna work.

JERRY: Really? I thought...

MARLENE: I know, I’m sorry.

JERRY: Gee, I just didn’t expect it from the way you’ve been acting.

MARLENE: You sure you want to talk about this? ‘Cause I sure don’t.

JERRY: Of course I want to talk about it.

MARLENE: Well, okay. I guess things changed for me on Tuesday night.

JERRY: Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?

MARLENE: I saw your act.

JERRY: My act? Wha-What does that have to do with anything?

MARLENE: Well, to be honest, it just didn’t make it for me. It’s just so much fluff.

JERRY: I can’t believe this. So what are you saying? You didn’t like my act, so that’s it?

MARLENE: I can’t be with someone if I don’t respect what they do.

JERRY: You’re a cashier!

MARLENE: Look, Jerry, it’s just wasn't my kind of humor.

JERRY: You can’t go by the audience that night. It was late. They were terrible.

MARLENE: I heard the material.

JERRY: I have other stuff. Y-You should come see me on the weekend.



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Women need to like the job of the guy they’re with. If they don’t like the job, they don’t like the guy. Men know this. Which is why we make up the phony, bogus names for the jobs that we have. “Well, right now, I’m the regional management supervisor. I’m in development, research, consulting...” Men on the other hand – if they are physically attracted to a woman – are not that concerned with her job. Are we? Men don’t really care. Men’ll just go, “Really? Slaughterhouse? Is that where you work? That sounds interesting. So whaddaya got a big cleaver there? You’re just lopping their heads off? That sounds great! Listen, why don’t you shower up, and we’ll get some burgers and catch a movie.”

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didn’t want to move to Florida, but they’re in their sixties, and that’s the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old people’s house with a golf cart, jump out, “Let’s go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it!” I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversation’s so boring. It’s so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, “What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass.” You know. Come back in, there’s broken glass, everybody’s all upset. “No, I’m all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, I’m fine. I came back. I wanted to hear a little more about that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose. Let’s pick it up right there.”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry’s father, Morty, is watching television. His mother, Helen, is ironing his father’s jacket.)

HELEN: You have so many nice jackets. I don’t know why you had to bring this jacket. Who wears a jacket like this? What’s wrong with that nice gray one? You have beautiful clothes. They sit in your closet. Morty, you can’t wear this!

(Jerry’s phone rings. Helen goes into the bathroom)

MORTY: Are you getting that?

HELEN: I thought you were getting it.

MORTY: Should I pick up?

HELEN: You want me to get that?

MORTY: I’ll get it!

HELEN: I’ll get it!

(They both go for the phone; Helen gets to it first.)

HELEN: Hello?... Hello?

(She hangs up. Jerry enters, wearing baseball clothes and carrying a bat and glove.)

JERRY: Hi.

HELEN: Hi.

JERRY: (to Morty) Would you make this thing lower! I can hear it on the street!

(Jerry picks up the remote and turns off the TV.)

MORTY: So, how’d you do?

JERRY: We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We’ll be in the championship game Wednesday because of me. It was the single greatest moment in my life.

HELEN: This is your greatest moment? A game?

JERRY: Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.

MORTY: You know what my greatest moment was, don’t you? Nineteen-forty-six. I went to work for Harry Flemming and I came up with the idea for the beltless trenchcoat.

HELEN: Jerry, look at this sport jacket. Is this a jacket to wear to an anniversary party?

JERRY: Well, the man’s an individualist – he worked for Harry Flemming. He knows what he’s doing.

HELEN: But it’s their 50th anniversary.

MORTY: Your mother doesn't like my taste in clothing.

HELEN: You know, I spoke to Manya and Isaac on the phone today. They invited you again. I think you should go.

JERRY: First of all, I made plans with Elaine.

HELEN: So bring her.

JERRY: I don’t even know them. What is she, your second cousin? I mean, I’ve met them three times in my life.

MORTY: I don’t know her either. (gesturing to Helen) She makes me fly all the way from Florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.

HELEN: At least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you’ll leave.

MORTY: How come he gets to leave?

JERRY: If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He’s always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it’s because so many people have left in the middle of his conversation.

MORTY: And it’s always about Jeffrey, right?

JERRY: Yeah. He talks about him like he split the atom. The kid works for the Parks Department.

(Enter Kramer.)

KRAMER: Morty, are you coming in?

MORTY: Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.

KRAMER: (to Jerry) Hey, how’d you do?

JERRY: We won. We’re in the finals on Wednesday.

KRAMER: Yeah!

JERRY: (to Kramer and Morty) What is this about?

KRAMER: I’m completely changing the configuration of the apartment. You’re not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.

JERRY: What are you doing?

KRAMER: Levels.

JERRY: Levels?

KRAMER: Yeah, I’m getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And I’m going to build these different levels, with steps, and it’ll all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You know, like ancient Egypt.

JERRY: You drew up plans for this?

KRAMER: No no. It’s all in my head.

MORTY: I don’t know how you’re going to be comfortable like that.

KRAMER: Oh, I’ll be comfortable.

JERRY: When do you intend to do this?

KRAMER: Ohh... should be done by the end of the month.

JERRY: You’re doing this yourself?

KRAMER: It’s a simple job. Why, you don’t think I can?

JERRY: Oh, no. It’s not that I don’t think you can. I know that you can’t, and I’m positive that you won’t.

KRAMER: Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is the lumber.

MORTY: Hey, that’s some big job.

JERRY: I, don’t see it happening.

KRAMER: Well, this time, this time you’re wrong. C’mon. I’ll even bet you.

JERRY: Seriously?

HELEN: I don’t want you betting. Morty, don’t let him bet.

KRAMER: A big dinner with dessert. But I’ve got till the end of the month.

JERRY: I’ll give you a year.

KRAMER: No no no. End of the month.

JERRY: It’s a bet.

(They “pinkie swear” to lock the deal.)



INT. MANYA & ISAAC’S APARTMENT – EVENING

(Jerry sits between Uncle Leo and Elaine. Elaine is sitting at the kiddie table, lower than everyone else. Helen and Morty sit across from Jerry. Manya and Isaac sit at the head of the table. Other guests are present as well.)

JERRY: (to Elaine) Seriously, do you wanna switch chairs?

ELAINE: No, no. I’m fine.

(Uncle Leo grabs Jerry’s arm.)

UNCLE LEO: Jerry, are you listening to this?

JERRY: Yeah, Uncle Leo.

UNCLE LEO: So, so, now the parks commissioner is recommending Jeffrey for a citation.

JERRY: Right. For the reducing of the pond scum?

UNCLE LEO: No, for the walking tours.

JERRY: Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life. The edible foliage tour.

UNCLE LEO: That’s exactly right. He knows the whole history of the park. For two hours he’s talking and answering questions. But you want to know something? Whenever he has a problem with one of these high-powered big shots in the Parks Department, you know who he calls?

JERRY: Mickey Mantle?

(Uncle Leo is confused by this comment.)

ELAINE: (saving Jerry from Leo) Jerry, Jerry. Did you taste these peas? (to Manya) These peas are great!

JERRY: (eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country fresh flavor.

ELAINE: Mmm... phenomenal peas.

MORTY: Are you ready for dessert?

JERRY: Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.

MANYA: (surprised) You’re going?

ELAINE: Oh uh, I don’t really eat dessert. I’m dieting.

JERRY: Yeah, I can’t eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles swell up, and I can’t dance.

MANYA : Can’t dance?

HELEN: He’s kidding, Manya.

MANYA: Is that a joke?

HELEN: So, did you hear Claire’s getting married?

MANYA: Yeah, yeah..

HELEN: I hear the fella owns a couple of racehorses. You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.

JERRY: Horses? They’re like big riding dogs.

ELAINE: What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that? And those kids who had their own ponies...

JERRY: I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that ever had a pony when they were growing up.

MANYA: (angry) I had a pony.

(The room goes dead quiet.)

JERRY: Well, I didn’t uh really mean a pony, per se...

MANYA: When I was a little girl in Poland, we all had ponies. My sister had pony, my cousin had pony... So, what’s wrong with that?

JERRY: Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressing...

HELEN: Should we have coffee? Who’s having coffee?

MANYA: He was a beautiful pony! And I loved him.

JERRY: Well, I’m sure you did. Who wouldn’t love a pony? Who wouldn’t love a person that had a pony?

MANYA: You! You said so!

JERRY: No, see, we didn’t have ponies. I’m sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..

MANYA: That’s it! I had enough!

(Manya gets up from the table and exits.)

ISAAC: Have your coffee, everybody. She’s a little upset. It’s been an emotional day.

(Isaac exits. Everyone looks at Jerry.)

JERRY: I didn’t know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrant’s going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin’ on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony? Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country? It doesn’t make sense. Am I wrong?



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Morty and Helen are collecting their luggage.)

JERRY: I’ll drive you to the airport.

HELEN: No, we’re taking a cab.

JERRY: I just hope that whole pony incident didn’t put a damper on the trip.

HELEN: Don’t be ridiculous. It was a misunderstanding.

MORTY: Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony.

JERRY: Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I’m sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.

HELEN: You know, you should give Manya a call.

JERRY: Maybe I will.

(Jerry opens his door. Kramer is standing in the hallway.)

KRAMER: Oh, hi. I uh just came to say goodbye.

(He points to the bags.)

KRAMER: Need any help with those?

MORTY: It’s nothing. I got it. So, how are your levels coming along?

KRAMER: Oh, well... I decided I’m not gonna do it.

JERRY: (laughing) Really? What a shock.

HELEN: Goodbye, Jerry.

JERRY: Take care.

HELEN: We’ll call you.

(Helen exits.)

MORTY: Bye, Jer.

JERRY: Bye, Dad. Take it easy.

MORTY: Bye, Mr. Kramer.

KRAMER: Yeah. So long, Morty.

(Morty leaves. Jerry closes the door. He and Kramer enter the kitchen. )

JERRY: So, when do I get my dinner?

KRAMER: There’s no dinner. The bet’s off. I’m not gonna do it.

JERRY: Yes, I know you’re not gonna do it. That’s why I bet.

KRAMER: Ya well, there’s no bet if I’m not doing it.

JERRY: That’s the bet! That you’re not doing it!

KRAMER: Yeah, well, I could do it. I don’t wanna do it.

JERRY: We didn’t bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would be done.

KRAMER: And it could be done.

JERRY: Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done! But it only is done if it’s done! Show me the levels! The bet is the levels!

KRAMER: I don’t want the levels!

JERRY: That’s the bet! (The phone rings; Jerry answers it.) Hello?... No- oh, hi... (Kramer leaves) no, they just left... Oh, my God... hang on a second. Maybe I can still catch ‘em. (Jerry goes over to the window and opens it; calling out the window) Ma! Ma! Up here! Don’t get in the cab! Manya died! Manya died!!



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – LATER

(Helen and Morty are back with Jerry.)

HELEN: Who did you talk to?

JERRY: Uncle Leo.

HELEN: And when’s the funeral?

JERRY: I don’t know. He said he’d call back.

MORTY: You know what this means, don’t you? We lost the Supersaver. Those tickets are non-refundable.

HELEN: She just had a check-up. The doctor said she was fine. Unless...

JERRY: What?

HELEN: What? Nothing.

JERRY: You don’t think... What? The pony remark?

HELEN: Oh, don’t be ridiculous. She was an old woman.

JERRY: You don’t think that I killed her?

MORTY: You know what the flight back’ll cost us?

JERRY: It was just an innocent comment! I didn’t know she had a pony!

MORTY: Maybe we can get an army transport flight. They got a base in Sarasota, I think.

JERRY: The whole thing was taking out of context. It was a joke. (The phone rings.) That’s probably Uncle Leo.

(Helen picks up.)

HELEN: Hello?... Yes, I know... Well, it’s just one of those things... Sure, sure, we’ll see you then.

(She hangs up.)

HELEN: The funeral’s Wednesday.

JERRY: Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?

HELEN: Two o’ clock, Wednesday.

JERRY: Ah

(Helen looks at Jerry.)

HELEN: What?

JERRY: I’ve got the softball game on Wednesday. It’s the championship.

HELEN: So? You’re not obligated. Go play in your game.

JERRY: I didn’t even know the woman.

HELEN: So don’t go.

JERRY: I mean I met her three times. I don’t even know her last name.

HELEN: Jerry, no one’s forcing you.

JERRY: I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That’s what I want to know. I mean, it’s the championship, I’m hitting everything.

HELEN: I don’t have a dress to wear. (to Morty) And you. You don’t have anything.

MORTY: I got my sport jacket.

HELEN: You’re not wearing that to a funeral.

MORTY: What’s wrong with it?

HELEN: It looks ridiculous.

MORTY: What? I’m gonna buy a new sport jacket now?

JERRY: I don’t know what to do.

MORTY: (depressed) You know what this funeral’s gonna wind up costing me? Oh boy!



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: We don’t understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you can’t stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I don’t see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, let’s make up our mind where we think they’re going.



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(Elaine and Jerry sit across from George at a booth.)

ELAINE: I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation. What time’s your game?

JERRY: Two Forty-Five.

ELAINE: And what time’s the funeral?

JERRY: Two o’ clock.

ELAINE: How long does a funeral take?

JERRY: Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure, even Oswald took forty-five minutes.

ELAINE: So you can’t do both?

JERRY: You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn’t expect her to go to my funeral. I would understand.

ELAINE: How can you even consider not going?

GEORGE: You know, I’ve been thinking. I cannot envision any circumstances in which I’ll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How’s it gonna happen? I just don’t see how it could occur.

ELAINE: You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality and how I’m actually gonna die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.

GEORGE: They always make me take stock of my life. And how I’ve pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting it.

JERRY: I know, and then you say to yourself, “From this moment on, I’m not gonna waste any more of it.” But then you go, “How? What can I do that’s not wasting it?”

ELAINE: Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can’t you have coffee with people?

GEORGE: You know, I can’t believe you’re even considering not playing. We need you. You’re hitting everything.

ELAINE: He has to go. He may have killed her.

JERRY: Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.

ELAINE: Oh, yeah, but I didn’t say I hated anyone who had one.

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Who’s going to play left field?

JERRY: Bender.

GEORGE: Bender? He can’t play left. He stinks. I just don’t see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care who’s at their funeral? They don’t even know they’re having a funeral. It’s not like she’s hanging out in the back going, “I can’t believe Jerry didn’t show up.”

ELAINE: Maybe she’s there in spirit. How about that?

GEORGE: If you’re a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think she’s gonna wanna hang around Drexler’s funeral home on Ocean Parkway?

ELAINE: George, I met this woman. She is not traveling to any other dimensions.

GEORGE: You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It’s not like getting on a bus. One second. (snaps his fingers) It’s all mental.

JERRY: Fifty years they were married. Now he’s moving to Pheonix.

ELAINE: Phoenix? What’s happening with his appartment?

JERRY: I don’t know. They’ve been in there since, like, World War II. The rent’s three hundred a month.

ELAINE: Three hundred a month? Oh, my God.



INT. FUNERAL HOME – DAY

(The eulogy is in progress. Jerry is in attendance.)

EULOGIST: Although this may seem like a sad event, it should not be a day of mourning. For Manya had a rich, fulfilling life. She grew up in a different world – a simpler world – with loving parents, a beautiful home in the country, and from what I understand, she eve had a pony. (Jerry throws up his hands.) Oh, how she loved that pony. Even in her declining years, whenever she would speak of it, her eyes would light up. It’s lustrous coat, it’s flowing mane. It was the pride of Krakow.

(Jerry sinks in his seat.)



INT. FUNERAL HOME – LATER

(Jerry and Elaine are talking to Helen. Jerry checks his watch.)

JERRY: Well, the game’s starting just about now.

HELEN: It was good that the two of you came. It was a nice gesture.

(Morty is talking to his NEPHEW on the other side of the room.)

NEPHEW: I’m not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty. I’m just an intern. I can’t write a note to an airline.

MORTY: You’ve got your degree. They don’t care. They just want to see something.

(Jerry is talking to Isaac.)

JERRY: I just wanted to say how sorry I was...

(Uncle Leo interrupts.)

UNCLE LEO: Jerry, you wanna hear something? Your cousin, Jeffrey, is switching parks. They’re transferring him to Riverside - so he’ll completely revamp that operation, you understand?

JERRY: Yeah.

UNCLE LEO: He’ll do in Riverside what he did in Central Park. More money. So, that’s your cousin.

(Morty is still talking to his nephew.)

MORTY: You don’t understand, I’ve never paid a full fare.

(Jerry and Elaine talk to Isaac.)

JERRY: Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am about the other night.

ELAINE: Oh, me too.

ISAAC: Oh, no no no. She forgot all about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad.

ELAINE: So, I understand you’re moving to Phoenix?

(Jerry shakes his head and walks away.)

ISAAC: Yeah, my brother lives there. I think Manya would’ve liked Phoenix.

ELAINE: Mmm, gorgeous, exquisite town. So, what’s happening with your apartment?

ISAAC: Of course it’s very hot there. I’ll have to get uh air conditioner.

ELAINE: Oh, you can have mine. I’ll ship it out to you. (Isaac isn't listening to Elaine) But what about that big apartment on West End Avenue?

ISAAC: Although they say it’s a dry heat.

ELAINE: Dry, wet... (trying to get through to him) what’s happening with your apartment?

ISAAC: I don’t even know if I should take my winter clothing.

ELAINE: I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment, and I’ll watch it for you and I’ll live there and I’ll make sure that nothing happens to it.

(Jerry returns.)

ISAAC: Oh, the apartment. Jeffrey’s taking the apartment.

ELAINE: Oh, Jeffrey.

JERRY: You know Jeffery?

ELAINE : Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.

(Helen approaches Jerry.)

HELEN: It’s raining.

(Jerry goes to the window.)

JERRY: It’s raining? It’s raining. The game will be postponed. We’ll play tomorrow.

(Back to Morty and his nephew.)

MORTY: Believe me, I wouldn’t bother you if the army hadn’t closed that base in Sarasota. Here, scribble a little something here.

NEPHEW: I can’t. I’ll get in trouble.

MORTY: Oh, for God’s sake!



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(George, Jerry and Elaine are sitting at a table. Jerry and George are wearing baseball uniforms.)

GEORGE: Who gets picked off in softball? It’s unheard of.

JERRY: It’s never happened to me before.

ELAINE: I remember saying to myself, “Why is Jerry so far off the base?”

JERRY: I’ll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.

(George consults his stat sheet of the game.)

GEORGE: And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?

JERRY: I thought there were two outs.

ELAINE: I couldn’t believe it when I saw you running. (laughing) I thought maybe they had changed the rules or something.

JERRY : It was the single worst moment of my life.

GEORGE: (smiling) What about Sharon Besser?

JERRY: Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three.

ELAINE: Makes you wonder, though, doesn’t it?

JERRY: Wonder about what?

ELAINE: You know... (looking up) the spirit world.

JERRY: You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?

ELAINE: I never saw anyone play like that.

JERRY: But I went to the funeral.

ELAINE: Yeah, but that doesn’t make up for killin’ her.

GEORGE: Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting another galaxy that day.

JERRY: Don’t you think she woulda heard I was there?

GEORGE: Not necessarily.

(Pause.)

JERRY: Who figures and immigrant’s gonna have a pony?

(Elaine laughs)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them? I mean, police don’t use them for, you know, crowd control. (Jerry crouches down, and makes like he’s riding a pony.) “Hey, uh, you wanna get back behind the barricades. Hey! Hey, little boy. Yeah, I’m talking to you. Behind the barricades!” So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldn’t it? Just have a little pony and you put him on the... “Baltic, that’s two down, go ahead. Hold it. Right there. Baltic. Yeah, that’s it. Fine. Right there, hold it right there.”

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking them out of my closet. I can’t stand every day trying to come up with little outfits for myself. I think eventually fashion won’t even exist. It won’t. I think eventually we’ll all be wearing the same thing. ‘Cause anytime I see a movie or a TV show where there’s people from the future or another planet, they’re all wearing the same thing. Somehow they decided, “This is going to be our outfit. One-piece silver jumpsuit, V-stripe, and boots. That’s it.” We should come up for an outfit for Earth. An Earth outfit. We should vote on it. Candidates propose different outfits. No speeches. They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, “That was nice. I could wear that.”



INT. CLOTHING STORE

(Jerry is talking to a SALESMAN. Elaine is also there, holding a book.)

JERRY : I think I’ve seen enough.

SALESMAN: Well, I might have something in the back.

(Salesman exits.)

ELAINE: The back? They never find anything in the back. If they had anything good in the back, they’d put it out in the front.

JERRY: Why don’t they open up an entire store for the back? Call it, “Just Back.” All back; No front. You walk in the front, you’re immediately in the back. (Jerry picks up a tie display, and shakes it rhythmically from left to right.) Look, Elaine, tie carwash.

(Elaine laughs. A CUSTOMER approaches, and notices the book Elaine is holding.)

CUSTOMER: Oh, I just read that. That’s terrific.

JERRY: (pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.

CUSTOMER: Alton Benes is your father?

ELAINE: Yeah.

CUSTOMER: I always felt he deserved a wider audience.

ELAINE: I’m not so sure he wants one.

(Customer exits.)

ELAINE: Hey, don’t forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury, eight o’clock.

JERRY: I guess I’m coming. I mean...

ELAINE: What? What, you don’t want to go now?

JERRY: No, I’ll go. I’m going.

ELAINE: No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven’t seen my father in a while and... you know...

JERRY: I’m worried I won’t be able to talk to him. He’s such a great writer. Frankly, I prefer the company of nitwits.

ELAINE: So, that’s why we’re not together anymore.

(Jerry pulls the invisible dagger Elaine just stabbed him with, out of his back. A jacket on a rack catches his eye.)

JERRY: What is this?

(He takes the jacket off the rack.)

JERRY: This is beautiful. These jackets never fit me right.

ELAINE: Try it on.

(Jerry puts on the jacket. Elaine feels the material.)

ELAINE: Wow, this is soft suede.

JERRY: This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.

(Elaine grabs the tag.)

JERRY: How much is it?

ELAINE: (shocked) Oh my God.

JERRY: Bad? (Elaine nods.) Very bad?

ELAINE: You have no idea.

JERRY: I have some idea.

ELAINE: No idea.

JERRY: I’ve got a ballpark.

ELAINE: There is no park and the team has relocated.

JERRY: Let me see that. (Jerry looks at the tag.) That is high.

ELAINE: Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.

(Jerry opens up the jacket and looks at the lining.)

JERRY: What’s with the pink lining and the candy stripes?

ELAINE: Well, it’s just a lining. You can always have it changed.

JERRY: Should I get it? I hate these moments. I’m hearing the dual voices now, you know, “What about the money?” “What’s money?”

(The salesman returns from the back.)

SALESMAN: It looks wonderful on you.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – MORNING

(Jerry is sitting on his couch wearing his new jacket over his pyjamas. He gets up to look at his jacket in the mirror. Kramer enters.)

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: Hey. New jacket?

JERRY: What do you think?

KRAMER: It’s beautiful.

JERRY: Is it me?

KRAMER: That’s definitely you.

JERRY: Really?

KRAMER: That’s more you than you’ve ever been. Hey, what is with the pink lining?

JERRY: I don’t know. It’s got a pink lining.

KRAMER: Oh... So, what did you pay for this?

JERRY : I paid what it costs.

KRAMER: How much?

JERRY: What’s the difference?

KRAMER: What, you’re not gonna tell me?

JERRY: I’d rather not say it out loud. It’s embarrassing.

KRAMER: Over three hundred?

JERRY: Yes, but let’s just stop it right there.

KRAMER: It’s over four hundred?

JERRY : Really, I’m not answering anymore.

KRAMER: Is it over four hundred?

JERRY: Would you?

(Kramer finds the tag hanging off the mirror.)

KRAMER: Woah, Nelson!

JERRY: I know, I know.

(Kramer walks over to Jerry’s old jacket, hanging by the door.)

KRAMER: What are you gonna do with the leather one?

JERRY: I don’t know.

KRAMER: Well, are you gonna wear it?

JERRY: Maybe.

KRAMER: You’re not going to wear this.

JERRY: Do you want it?

KRAMER: Well, yeah. Okay. I’ll take it. I like the jacket.

(Jerry considers giving up the leather jacket.)

JERRY: Okay, take it.

KRAMER: Heey, good karma for you. (Kramer puts on Jerry’s old jacket and stands next to Jerry, looking in the mirror.) Oh baby.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry is sitting on the couch. George enters.)

GEORGE: (singing) “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm/Tells a saucy talk/Loves to make a stir/Everyone appreciates a...”

JERRY: What is that song?

GEORGE: Oh, it’s from Les Miserables. I went to see it last week. I can’t get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over. It just comes out. I have no control over it. I’m singin’ it on elevators, buses. I’m singin’ it in front of clients. It’s taken over my life.

JERRY: You know, Schumann went mad from that.

GEORGE: Artie Schuman? From Camp Hatchapee?

JERRY: No, you idiot.

GEORGE: What are you, Bud Abbott? What are you callin’ me an idiot?

JERRY: You don’t know Robert Schumann? The composer?

GEORGE: Oh, Schumann. Of course.

JERRY: He went crazy from one note. He couldn’t get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating it over and over again. He had to be institutionalized.

GEORGE: Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesn’t stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Let’s just go, All right? I can’t believe we’re having dinner with Alton Benes.

JERRY: I know exactly what’s gonna happen tonight. I’m gonna try and act like I’m not impressed, he’s gonna see right through it.

GEORGE: Yeah, he’ll be looking at us like he’s backstage at a puppet show.

JERRY: Let me just get my jacket.

(Jerry enters the bedroom.)

GEORGE: (singing) : “Master of the house/Keeper of the inn...” (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?

JERRY: Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When I leave the house in this, it’s with a whole different confidence. Like tonight, I might’ve been a little nervous. But, inside this jacket, I am composed, grounded, secure that I can meet any social challenge.

GEORGE: Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.

JERRY: Absolutely.

GEORGE: It’s fabulous.

JERRY: I know.

GEORGE: And I’ll tell you something else, I’m not even going to ask you. I want to know. But I’m not gonna ask. You’ll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores George’s questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Can’t be seven. Don’t tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what you’re saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I won’t say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) I’m walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! I’ll tell you what, if you don’t say anything in the next five seconds, I’ll know it was over a thousand.

(George gets ready with his watch. Enter Kramer.)

KRAMER: (to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?

JERRY: Well, what kind of solid?

KRAMER: I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while it’s double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.

JERRY: Birds?

KRAMER: Yeah. A friend of mine, he’s a magician. He’s going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.

JERRY: So take a cab.

KRAMER: They won’t take a cage full of birds.

JERRY: I can’t. I’m on my way out. There’s no way I can do it.

KRAMER: George, do me a solid? Two minutes.

GEORGE: Well, I’m going with him. I’d like to... I’ve never done a ‘solid’ before.

KRAMER: All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.

(Kramer leaves.)

JERRY: (scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes. By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand years.



INT. HOTEL WESTBURY’S LOBBY – NIGHT

(Jerry and George enter.)

GEORGE: (singing) “Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...”

(Jerry points to his head with a “crazy” gesture.)

JERRY: Schumann. (George stops himself, frightened. Jerry looks around the lobby.) Where are they?

GEORGE: Maybe he didn’t show up.

(George starts to leave the hotel.)

JERRY: What, you don’t want to do this?

GEORGE: I don’t think there’s ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?

JERRY: Yeah, I think it is. (They walk toward the man. Jerry hesitates.) Where’s Elaine?

GEORGE: I’m nervous.

JERRY: (to the man) Excuse me. Mister Benes?

ALTON: Yeah?

JERRY: I’m Jerry, Elaine’s friend, and this is George.

(George offers his hand to Alton.)

GEORGE: It’s a great thrill to meet you, Sir.

(Alton starts hacking. George withdraws his hand. Alton gestures to a couch beside the leather chair.)

ALTON: Sit down. Want a drink?

(Jerry and George sit.)

JERRY: Sure.

(Alton summons the waiter, who approaches.)

ALTON: What’ll you have?

JERRY: (to waiter) I’ll have a cranberry juice with two limes.

GEORGE: And, I’ll have a club soda with no ice.

BENES: I’ll have another Scotch with plenty of ice.

(The waiter exits.)

GEORGE: You like ice?

ALTON: Huh?

GEORGE: I said, do you like ice?

ALTON: Like it?

GEORGE: Don’t you think you get more without it?

ALTON: Where’s Elaine?

JERRY: Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She’s usually pretty punctual. Don’t you find that, George?

GEORGE: Yeah, yeah. She’s punctual... and uh she’s been late, sometimes.

JERRY: Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she’s on time, and... sometimes she’s late.

GEORGE: I guess... (chuckles) today she’s late.

JERRY: It appears that way.

GEORGE: Yup.

JERRY: Yup.

(Jerry and George look at the door, anticipating Elaine’s arrival.)

ALTON: Looks like rain.

GEORGE: I know, I know, that’s what they said.

ALTON: Who said?

GEORGE: The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.

ALTON: I don’t need anybody to tell me it’s gonna rain.

GEORGE: No, of course not. I didn’t-

ALTON: All I have to do is stick my head out the window. (The waiter returns with the drinks, and distributes them to the men.) Which one’s suppose to be the funny guy?

GEORGE: (pointing at Jerry) Oh, he’s the comedian.

JERRY: I’m just a regular person.

GEORGE: No, no. He’s just being modest.

ALTON: We had a funny guy with us in Korea. Tailgunner. They blew his brains out all over the Pacific. There’s nothing funny about that.

(Jerry and George turn to the door again. Pause. Jerry gets up.)

JERRY: Would you excuse me a minute? I’m gonna go to the bathroom. I’ll be right back.

(George holds on to Jerry’s jacket, but he pulls away and exits. George is alone with Alton.)

GEORGE: I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game. I thought it was just brilliant.

ALTON: Drivel.

GEORGE: Yea, well, maybe some parts.

ALTON: (defensive) What parts?

GEORGE: The... drivel... parts. Oh my gosh, I just realized – I have to make a phone call. I-I can’t believe- Would you-

(George leaves.)



INT. HOTEL WESTBURY’S BATHROOM – CONTINUING

(Jerry is washing his face. George enters.)

GEORGE: Thank you for leaving me alone with him!

JERRY: That was brutal. I can’t go back out there.

GEORGE: Well, let’s just leave.

JERRY: Elaine’ll kill me.

GEORGE: Where is she?

JERRY: She’s gotta be here soon.

GEORGE: How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and that’s it! I’m leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.

JERRY: The waiter was trembling!

GEORGE: If she doesn’t show up, we can’t possibly have dinner with him alone.

JERRY: How are we gonna get out of it?

GEORGE: We’ll say we’re frightened and we have to go home.

JERRY: Yeah, that’s good. He’d clunk our heads together like Moe.

GEORGE: I don’t know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. He’ll understand that.



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: All fathers are intimidating. They’re intimidating because they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life, his attitude is, “To hell with the world, I can make my own people. I’ll eat whatever I want, I’ll wear whatever I want, and I’ll create whoever I want.”



INT. HOTEL WESTBURY’S LOBBY – NIGHT

(Jerry and George return from the bathroom.)

ALTON: (to George) Who’d you call?

GEORGE: (improvising) My uh uncle is having an operation. I just wanted to see how he was.

ALTON: What kind of operation?

GEORGE: Bone marrow.

(The hotel’s MANAGER approaches.)

MANAGER: Mister Benes?

ALTON: Yes?

MANAGER: A message for you.

(The manager hands him a message written on a piece of paper. Alton reads it to himself.)

ALTON: From Elaine. She got tied up. She’ll be here in thirty minutes.

(Jerry and George freeze.)



INT. HOTEL LOBBY – LATER

(Alton is in the middle of a rant.)

ALTON: Yeah, they should’ve taken care of Castro when they had the chance. Like we did in Guatamala in ‘fifty-three.

JERRY: Well, Guatamala...

GEORGE: Sure, Guatamala...

(Alton gets up.)

ALTON: All right, you boys get yourselves together. We’ll head up to the restaurant. I’ll leave a note for Elaine. I’m going to the bathroom.

(Alton exits.)

GEORGE: Come on, let’s go!

JERRY: What about Elaine?

GEORGE: To hell with Elaine!

JERRY: She’ll be furious.

GEORGE: We’re dying here!

(Elaine enters.)

JERRY: That’s her! She’s here!

ELAINE: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Where is Dad?

GEORGE: (contemptuously, imitating Alton’s voice) He’s in the bathroom.

JERRY: (to Elaine) Where have you been?!

ELAINE: Kramer! That... Kramer! I’m just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...

JERRY: Oh, you didn’t...

ELAINE: Well, he said he’d drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesn’t come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. He’s a city marshal. He’s towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, we’re wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now we’re running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Alton’s chair and takes a deep breath.) So how’s everything going over here?

JERRY: Great.

GEORGE: Couldn’t be better.

ELAINE: Good. ‘Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.

JERRY: Oh, no, no.

GEORGE: Get outta here..

ELAINE: Man, Kramer! I could kill him!

JERRY: I can’t believe it. You know better than to get involved with Kramer.

ELAINE : He said he’d give me a lift.

JERRY: Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren’s song. Never what it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?

GEORGE: Where do you come up with this stuff?

(Alton returns.)

ALTON: Well, look who’s here.

ELAINE: Oh, hi, Dad.

ALTON: Hello, dear.

(Alton kisses Elaine.)

ALTON: Who’s the lipstick for?

ELAINE: No one.

ALTON: How’s your mother?

ELAINE: Fine.

ALTON: How about you? Are you working?

ELAINE: Yeah, I’m reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.

ALTON: Pendant! Those bastards. Well all right, boys. We’ll go to that Pakistani restaurant on 46th Street. You’re not afraid of a little spice, are you?

(They all head for the door. Jerry and George trail behind a little.)

GEORGE: (singing) “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open...”

ALTON: Pipe down, chorus boy.

(Alton glares; George gets embarrassed. Elaine looks out the window.)

ELAINE: Ohh... it’s snowing. It’s beautiful.

JERRY: (to George) Snow. Snow, that can’t be good for suede, can it?

GEORGE: I wouldn’t think so.

JERRY: What should I do? (to Alton) Uh, we’re taking a cab, aren’t we?

ALTON: Cab? It’s only five blocks.

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Why don’t you just turn it inside out?

JERRY: Inside out! Great.

(Jerry turns his jacket inside out, exposing the pink stripes. Alton stops him before Jerry can leave the hotel.)

ALTON: Wait a minute. What the hell do you call this?

JERRY: Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.

ALTON: Well, you look like a damn fool!

JERRY: Well, it’s a new suede jacket. It might get ruined.

ALTON: Well, you’re not going to walk down the street with me and my daughter dressed like that. That’s for damn sure.

(Jerry looks to George.)

GEORGE: It’s uh, it's only a few blocks.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry is heading out. The intercom buzzes. Jerry presses the first button.)

JERRY: (to the intercom) Elaine?

ELAINE: Yeah.

JERRY: Come on up.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Hey.

KRAMER: I’ve gotta feed the birds.

JERRY: So?

KRAMER: You got any of those mini Ritzes?

(Jerry reaches up, and pulls some mini Ritzes from atop his refrigerator. He examines the box.)

JERRY: I can’t believe I do.

KRAMER: Yeah! Well, are you going out?

JERRY: Yeah.

KRAMER: Hey, where’s your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. It’s ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?

JERRY: I was out in the snow last night.

KRAMER: Don’t you know what that does to suede?

JERRY: I have an idea. (Elaine enters; to Elaine) We can make the nine-thirty at Cinema Three.

ELAINE: Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.

JERRY: Is he still in town?

ELAINE: No, he’s driving back to Maryland tonight.

(Kramer is holding a sleeve of the suede jacket.)

KRAMER: So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?

JERRY: I don’t know.

KRAMER: (smiling) Well...

ELAINE: (to Jerry) I didn’t want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.

JERRY: Really?

KRAMER: You gonna throw this out?

JERRY: Well, I can’t wear it.

ELAINE: Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.

KRAMER: (to Jerry) Well, if you’re just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.

JERRY: Yeah, go ahead, take it.

ELAINE: Dad thinks George is gay.

JERRY: Oh, because of all the singing?

ELAINE: No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.

(Kramer returns from the bathroom, wearing the ruined suede jacket.)

KRAMER: Hey, see, I like it like this.

(Elaine points at the jacket Kramer is wearing.)

ELAINE: Isn’t that...? (Jerry nods.) Oh, is this from the snow last night? (Jerry nods.) Ugh... you know what you should’ve done? You should’ve turned it inside out.

JERRY: I’ll try and remember that.

(Kramer is holding Jerry’s old leather jacket.)

KRAMER: Boy, it’s too bad you gave me this one too.

JERRY: Yeah, too bad.

(Kramer opens up the suede jacket.)

KRAMER: I’m gonna have to do something about this lining.

(Kramer exits.)



INT. ALTON’S CAR – NIGHT

(Alton is driving home.)

ALTON: (singing) “Master of the house/Doling out the charm/Ready with a handshake and an open palm...”



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture ruin leather? I don’t get this. Aren’t cows outside most of the time? I don’t understand it. When it’s raining do cows go up to the farmhouse, “Let us in, we’re all wearin’ leather. Open the door! We’re gonna ruin the whole outfit here!” “Is it suede?” “I am suede, the whole thing is suede, I can’t have this cleaned. It’s all I got!”

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what you’re doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? “We have soda, we have soda, we have soda”, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. It’s a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and you’re watching TV and you’re drinking the exact same product that they’re advertising right there on TV, and it’s like, you know, they’re spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and I’m standing there, “Maybe I’m putting too much ice in mine.”



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(George and Jerry enter.)

GEORGE: (excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn’t sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I don’t know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like they’re psychotic or something and I don’t know if I’m supposed to smile back, I don’t know what to do. So I just stood there like – remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? That’s what I looked like.

JERRY: So you didn’t ask?

GEORGE: No, I froze.

(Jerry points to the coffee shop’s counter.)

JERRY: Counter.

(Jerry and George sit down at the counter.)

GEORGE: Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I’m back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, “So why don’t you call her?” I says, “I can’t.” I couldn’t, I couldn’t do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.

JERRY: He said wuss?

GEORGE: Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.

JERRY: So you called.

GEORGE: Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.

JERRY: Yeah. Like a farm boy.

GEORGE: Right. So I call her up, I tell her it’s me, she gives me an enthusiastic ‘Hi!’

JERRY: Wow. The enthusiastic hi. That’s beautiful.

GEORGE: Oh, I don’t get the enthusiastic hi, I’m outta there.

JERRY: All right, so you’re chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.

GEORGE: So, we’re talking, and I don’t like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, “What are you doing Saturday night?”

JERRY: And?

GEORGE: She bought.

JERRY: Great day in the morning.

GEORGE: Then I got off the phone right away.

JERRY: Sure, it’s like robbing a bank. You don’t loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.

GEORGE: It’s amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I can’t remember the last time that happened.



INT. GEORGE’S CAR – SATURDAY NIGHT

(George and his date, Carol, are parked outside Carol’s building.)

GEORGE: I can’t stand doing laundry. That’s why I have forty pairs of underwear.

CAROL: You do not.

GEORGE: Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.

(They both laugh.)



INT. JERRY’S CAR – SATURDAY NIGHT

(Jerry and his date, DONNA are parked outside Donna’s building.)

JERRY: (in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.

DONNA: That’s Irish.

JERRY: Irish, Scottish, what’s the difference, lassie?

(Donna laughs.)



INT. GEORGE’S CAR – CONTINUED

CAROL: So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.

GEORGE: Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.

CAROL: Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?

GEORGE: Oh, no, thanks. I can’t drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.

CAROL: (confused by his response) So, um, okay.

GEORGE: Okay.

CAROL: Goodnight.

GEORGE: Yeah, take it easy.

(Carol exits the car. George realizes what he has done and slaps his forehead in disgust.)



INT. JERRY’S CAR – CONTINUED

DONNA: Thanks again for the movie.

JERRY: You’re welcome.

DONNA: I’d invite you up, but the place is being painted.

JERRY: Oh, that’s okay.

DONNA: Unless you want to go to your place.

JERRY: Okay... but there’s no cake or anything, if that’s what you’re looking for.



INT. GEORGE’S CAR (MOVING) – CONTINUED

GEORGE: (frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT

(Jerry and Donna sit on the sofa.)

JERRY: I think if one’s going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. It’s common courtesy. I don’t know. That’s just the way I was brought up.

DONNA: Values are very important.

JERRY: Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?

DONNA: Thursday’s great.

(Pause. Jerry looks down at his pants.)

JERRY: Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I don’t feel comfortable in them.

DONNA: Are those Cotton Dockers?

JERRY: Oh, I can’t begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.

DONNA: Really? I like that commercial.

(Donna gets closer and more comfortable leaning on Jerry. Jerry Pauses thinking about what she said)

JERRY: You like that commercial?

DONNA: Yeah, it’s clever.

JERRY: Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?

DONNA: Yeah, that’s the one.

JERRY: What could you possibly like about that?

DONNA: I don’t know. I like the, guys.

JERRY: Yeah, they’re so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.

DONNA : Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.

(After Jerry sits back again, Donna continues get more comfortable in Jerry's arms. Jerry pauses.)

JERRY: Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesn’t that bother you?

DONNA: (annoyed) That’s the idea. That’s what’s clever about it, that they’re not talking about the pants.

JERRY: But they’re talking about nothing.

DONNA: That’s the point.

JERRY: I know the point.

DONNA: No one is telling you to like it.

JERRY: I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?

(Donna sighs, leans away from Jerry and looks at her watch.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: What’s brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy’ll be like, “I don’t think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life?” And of course the woman’s looking at the guy, thinking, “What is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?”



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry and Elaine are talking.)

JERRY: I’m supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?

ELAINE: I once broke up with a guy because he didn’t keep his bathroom clean enough.

JERRY: No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?

ELAINE: Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there – they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

(George enters, looking miserable, holding a brown paper bag.)

ELAINE: Hi.

(George produces a bottle of Pepto-Bismol and box of bicarb (sic) from bag, placing them on counter.)

JERRY: You’re still thinking about this?

GEORGE: She invites me up at twelve o’clock at night, for coffee, and I don’t go up. “No thank you. I don’t want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee.” I said this to her. People this stupid shouldn’t be allowed to live. I can’t imagine what she must think of me.

JERRY: She thinks you’re a guy that doesn’t like coffee.

GEORGE: She invited me up. Coffee’s not coffee, coffee is sex.

ELAINE: Maybe coffee was coffee.

GEORGE: Coffee’s coffee in the morning. It’s not coffee at twelve o’clock at night.

ELAINE: Well some people drink coffee that late.

GEORGE: Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who’re on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, “Keep it up, don’t blow it, you’re doing great.”

ELAINE: It’s all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.

GEORGE: I can’t call her now. It’s too soon. I’m planning a Wednesday call.

ELAINE: Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.

GEORGE: Of course you do, but you’re imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, “Oh no, I don’t drink coffee late at night.” If I call her now, she’s gonna think I’m too needy. Women don’t wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy – a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.

ELAINE: All she’ll think is that you like her.

GEORGE: That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!

ELAINE: Well, she wants you to like her.

GEORGE: Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesn’t like me!

ELAINE: I don’t know what your parents did to you.

(Kramer enters and addresses Jerry.)

KRAMER: Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, you’re up there, you’re on the stage and you go, “Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someone’s in a life-and-death situation, and we’re thinking, “Well, sorry buddy, you should’ve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.”

(Elaine laughs. Jerry humors Kramer with a smile.)

KRAMER: So you gonna use it?

JERRY : I don’t think so.

KRAMER: It’s funny.

ELAINE: It is funny.

JERRY: I like to use my own material.

KRAMER: That’s as good as anything you do.

GEORGE: All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.

JERRY: Why do we have to leave?

GEORGE: Because I can’t call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, let’s go.

ELAINE: Oh, see, this is the problem.

JERRY: You’re kicking me out of my house?

GEORGE: Yes.

(Jerry exits. Elaine is in the doorway.)

ELAINE: (encouraging) Don’t forget.

GEORGE: (to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?

JERRY: Don’t do the apples. It’s enough already with the apples.

(Elaine, Kramer and Jerry exit. George removes his jacket and dials the phone.)

CAROL: (from the phone; a recorded message) Hi, it’s Carol, I’ll get back to you.

(A beep follows.)

GEORGE: Um, hi, it’s George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didn’t come up for coffee. You see, I didn’t realise that coffee didn’t really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. It’s up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The ball’s in your court. So uh, take it easy.

(George hangs up. Jerry enters.)

JERRY: I’m just gonna get my jacket, I’ll meet you downstairs. What’s the matter, did you call?

(Elaine enters.)

GEORGE: Got her machine. I’m dead, I’m a dead man. That’s it. I’m dead, I’m a dead man. Dead man.

JERRY: What did you say?

GEORGE: I don’t know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and there’s nothing I can do. It’s a machine. The little light is blinking right now, “Come and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot’s on!”

JERRY: After one date you try and improvise on her machine?

GEORGE: Now I’m in the worst position of all.

ELAINE: Y’know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy’s machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasn’t supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guy’s house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.

GEORGE: He did that?

ELAINE: Yeah.

GEORGE: Somebody did that?

JERRY: She’ll call you back. You’re overreacting.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(Jerry is in the kitchen. Donna is on the other side of the counter.)

JERRY: Not once.

DONNA: Never?

JERRY: I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.

DONNA: That’s amazing.

JERRY: Thank you.

DONNA: Is there anything else about you I should know?

JERRY: Yes, I’m lactose intolerant.

DONNA: Really?

JERRY: I have no patience for lactose. And I won’t stand for it. Um, I’ll be right back.

(Jerry goes to the bathroom. George bursts into the apartment.)

GEORGE: Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, I’m sorry, I didn’t, I had no idea.

(He goes to leave.)

DONNA: Wait, wait. He’s in the bathroom.

GEORGE: I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I’ll come back.

DONNA: You don’t have to leave.

GEORGE: You sure?

DONNA: Yes.

GEORGE: Okay.

DONNA: I’m Donna.

GEORGE: Donna. Oh, you’re the one that likes that commercial!

DONNA: He told you about that?

GEORGE: (back-pedalling) No, he, he didn’t actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial – in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. He’s, he’s like a clam. You’re not gonna mention this, to him...

(Jerry re-enters.)

DONNA: (to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends I’m not hip because I like that commercial.

JERRY: What? (to George) What did, what did you say?

GEORGE: Say? What? Nothing, I...

DONNA: You told him how I like the commercial.

JERRY: Well, so what if I said that?

DONNA: Well, so, you didn’t have to tell your friends.

JERRY: No, I had to tell my friends – my friends didn’t have to tell you.

GEORGE: (to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?

DONNA: I don’t like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.

GEORGE: Boy oh boy.

JERRY: I said I couldn’t believe you liked that commercial. So what?

DONNA: I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.

JERRY: Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: Hey.

JERRY: Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.

KRAMER: Oh. Cotton Dockers!

GEORGE: Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...

(George grabs Kramer.)

KRAMER: What? Where are we going?

GEORGE: Come on!

DONNA: Don’t bother, I’m leaving.

JERRY: Donna, really, you’re making too much of this.

KRAMER: “One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If they’re not Dockers, they’re just pants”

JERRY: Please, Donna...

DONNA: I don’t wanna hear it.

(Donna leaves.)

GEORGE: I can’t believe I said that. You know me, I’m a vault.

JERRY: Don’t worry about it, it wasn’t working anyway.

KRAMER: What happened there?

JERRY: I’ll tell you later.

GEORGE: You are not gonna believe what’s going on with this woman.



INT. MONK’S DINER – DAY

(George and Jerry sat at a booth.)

GEORGE: Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn’t call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, “I know you’re there, I don’t know what your story is.” Yesterday, I’m a volcano – I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, “Where the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you don’t call me back for four days? I don’t like coffee, I don’t have to come up. I’d like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.”

JERRY: You said that?

GEORGE: I lost it.

JERRY: I can’t blame you. I can’t believe she never called you back.

GEORGE: She did. Today.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: She called my office. She said she’s been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didn’t know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and she’s been using her old machine and she doesn’t have the beeper for it.

JERRY: So she didn’t get the messages.

GEORGE: Exactly, but they’re on there – waiting. She said she can’t wait to see me, we’re having dinner tonight. She’s supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.

JERRY: But what about the messages?

(George produces cassette tape from pocket.)

JERRY: Elaine’s thing? How you gonna get in?

GEORGE: I’ll meet her outside the building.

JERRY: But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she’s going right for that machine.

GEORGE: Unless she goes for the bathroom. That’s my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I can’t do this, I can’t do this. I don’t even know how to work those stupid machines.

JERRY: There’s nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.

GEORGE: You do it for me.

JERRY: What?

GEORGE: Come on, it’ll be so much easier.

JERRY: How you gonna get me up there?

GEORGE: I’ll tell her I bumped into you, I’m giving you a ride uptown.

JERRY: And who makes the switch?

GEORGE: You do.

JERRY: I do.

GEORGE : I can’t do it. I’ll, I’ll keep her busy.

JERRY: I can’t get involved in this.

GEORGE: I think I may be in love with this woman.

JERRY: What if she sees me?

GEORGE: Oh, you are such a wuss.

JERRY: A wuss?

GEORGE: Yeah.

JERRY: Did you call me a wuss?



EXT. CAROL’S BUILDING – NIGHT

(George and Jerry are sitting on a low wall beside the door to the building.)

GEORGE: Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.

JERRY: I got one problem. You’re keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that she’s coming.

GEORGE: A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, I’ll call out tippy-toe!

JERRY: Tippy Toe? I don’t think so.

GEORGE: You don’t like tippy toe?

JERRY: No tippy toe.

GEORGE: All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, I’ll sing.

JERRY: What song?

GEORGE: “How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?”

JERRY: What is that?

GEORGE: Oh, it’s a lovely song. (singing) “How do you solve a problem like Maria?...”

JERRY: Anything else?

GEORGE: You pick it.

JERRY: “Lemon Tree.”

GEORGE: Peter, Paul and Mary.

JERRY: No, Trini Lopez.

JERRY & GEORGE: (singing) “Lemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...”

GEORGE: Alright ok. You got the tape?

(Jerry takes out two different sizes of cassettes.)

JERRY: Standard. Micro.

GEORGE: How do you feel? Confident?

JERRY: Feel good.

GEORGE: You nervous?

JERRY: Not at all.

GEORGE: Get up, get up, it’s her! Oh, the hell with this, I’m scared to death, just walk away, it’s off, cancel everything, go!

(Carol enters.)

CAROL: Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.

GEORGE: I, I couldn’t wait. I was too anxious to see you.

CAROL: Oh, that’s so sweet.

GEORGE: Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isn’t that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.

JERRY: All the time.

CAROL: It’s nice to meet you.

JERRY: Hi.

CAROL: So, I’m starving. Where are we gonna eat?

GEORGE: You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.

CAROL: Okay. Let’s go, I’m ready, where’d you park?

GEORGE: Don’t you wanna go upstairs first?

CAROL: No, what for? I’ll just give my bag to the doorman.

JERRY: You know, I really need to use the bathroom.

CAROL: Oh well there’s a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.

GEORGE: Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...

CAROL: Well they have a phone.

(George takes Carol aside.)

GEORGE: I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.

CAROL: (aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine.

GEORGE: Right, right.

(They enter her building.)



INT. CAROL’S APARTMENT – CONTINUING

(Carol, Jerry and George enter.)

CAROL: The bathroom’s on the hall to the right.

JERRY: Uh, you know, why don’t you go first, you just had a long trip.

CAROL: No, I’m fine.

JERRY: Um, you know, it’s the damnedest thing. It went away.

CAROL: Oh, that’s weird.

GEORGE: No, no that can happen. I’ve, uh, I’ve read about that in medical journals. It’s a freak thing, but...

CAROL: Well, let me just check my messages, and we’ll go.

GEORGE: Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?

CAROL: Sure.

GEORGE: Please, this is very, very important.

(George leads her to another room. Jerry goes over and lifts the lid of the machine.)

GEORGE: (from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!

(Carol reappears, followed by George.)

CAROL: (to Jerry) Now I know who you are! You’re a comedian. I’ve seen you, it’s driving me crazy.

JERRY: Right. I am.

GEORGE: Carol, that’s so rude. Please, I’m serious, just for a moment, if you wouldn’t mind. And then we’ll talk to Jerry.

(George leads Carol back out. Jerry switches the tapes.)

JERRY: (calls) Hey you two. I’m ready to go.

(George and Carol return.)

CAROL: That’s what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?

GEORGE: (to Jerry) Don’t you find that strange?

JERRY: Yes.

CAROL: Well, I’ll just check my machine and we’ll go.

(She lifts the lid of the machine, and drops it.)

CAROL: No, nothing here, let’s go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.

GEORGE: Oh, uh...

CAROL: Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.

(Carol exits. Jerry laughs acidly while looking at George. They exit as well.)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry in on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didn’t want to talk to, I could go, “Excuse me, I’m not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away.” I also have a cordless phone, but I don’t like that as much, because you can’t slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone – “You can’t talk to me like that!” Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone – “You can’t talk to me like that!”
(Jerry searches for the ‘off’ button on his mimed phone, and presses it feebly.) “I told him!”

INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: Well, I painted my apartment again. I’ve been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, it’s a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize it’s just the thickness of the paint, but I’m aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, it’s closer and closer. I don’t even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. That’s where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... That’s why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. That’s why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry and Elaine are looking at Kramer with their arms folded. His hair is slicked back.)

JERRY: What did you do?

KRAMER: Mousse. I moussed up.

ELAINE: I guess it was just a matter of time.

KRAMER: You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel like I've had two lives. My pre-mousse. And now, I begin my post-mousse. Hey, tell me the truth, have you ever seen a better looking guy?

JERRY: Well, looks are so subjective.

ELAINE: I don’t mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.

KRAMER: (annoyed that he forgot) Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that!

ELAINE: She lives right above First Avenue, says she has a perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.

JERRY: Maybe.

(A loud argument can be heard in the hallway between HAROLD and MANNY, the building supervisors.

HAROLD: (O.S.) No, I’m not going up there.

(Manny screams out something in Spanish.)

JERRY: (to Elaine) Harold and Manny.



INT. BUILDING’S HALLWAY – CONTINUING

(Harold and Manny are arguing.)

HAROLD: I’m not going.

(Manny says something in Spanish. Jerry enters the hallway.)

JERRY: Boys, boys.

HAROLD: Oh, Jerry.

JERRY: I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?

HAROLD: Yeah, yeah... Hey, Jerry, would you like anything from Mrs. Hudwalker’s apartment?

MANNY: (in Spanish) You can't give him anything from there!

HAROLD: I was only joking. (to Jerry) He thinks I’m gonna give you Mrs. Hudwalker’s things.

MANNY: (in Spanish) You offered them to him.

HAROLD: (to Jerry) We have to go up there now and clean the apartment. It’s a good thing her rent was overdue. She’d be rotting up there for a month.

JERRY: She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?

HAROLD: Ninety-four years old. I found her yesterday. She didn’t have her wig on. It was horrifying.

MANNY: (in Spanish) Harold, Come on, hurry up!

HAROLD: (to Manny) What’s the matter with you? I’m talking! So, Jerry, you know anyone who needs an apartment?

JERRY: Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?

HAROLD: Oh yeah, I like her. She always says hello to me.

JERRY: It’s not promised to anybody? ‘Cause she’d take it in a second.

HAROLD: Well, Manny wanted it for his brother, but he got deported.

MANNY: (in spanish) What do you mean deported? It was a misunderstanding with the Department of Immigration.

HAROLD: What’s the difference? It’s true!

JERRY: So, it’s okay? I could just tell her she can have it?

HAROLD: Sure, sure. She’s getting a bargain, too. It’s only four hundred dollars a month.

MANNY: (in Spanish) Four hundred dollars? What are you nuts? Someone will pay more.

HAROLD: Okay...

(Manny keeps talking in Spanish.)

HAROLD: Okay!

(Jerry goes back to his apartment, passing Kramer on the way. Kramer models his new hairdo for the boys.)

KRAMER: Hey, Harold, what do you think?

HAROLD: Manny, look. Kramer put mousse in his hair.

MANNY: (in Spanish) It looks worse.

KRAMER: (not understanding him) Hey, thanks.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry enters.)

ELAINE: What was that all about?

JERRY: (coyly) Oh, nothing important.

ELAINE: What’s going on? What is that look?

JERRY: What look? Nothing.

ELAINE: Something’s going on here.

JERRY: I don’t know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I can’t decide.

ELAINE: Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C’mon. Cough it up.

JERRY: Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am – rarely ever thinking of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me. Sure, it hurts sometimes to give, and give, and give...

ELAINE: Would you please?

JERRY: What would you say if I told you that...

(Jerry lets his words hang in the air.)

ELAINE: Told me what?!

JERRY: ...I got you an apartment in this building.

ELAINE: (dumbfounded) No.

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: Yes.

ELAINE: You didn’t.

JERRY: I did.

ELAINE: You got me an apartment in the building?!

JERRY: I got you an apartment in the building.

ELAINE: How did you...

JERRY: Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman who lived above me?

ELAINE: No.

JERRY: She died.

ELAINE: (thrilled) She died?!

JERRY: She died.

ELAINE: She died!

JERRY: And the rent is only four hundred dollars a month!

ELAINE: Get out!

(Elaine pushes Jerry with both hands. Jerry stumbles back.)

ELAINE: Four hundred a month? Only four hundred a month?!

JERRY: Four hundred a month.

ELAINE: And I’ll be right upstairs?

JERRY: Right upstairs.

ELAINE: Right above you?

JERRY: Right above me.

ELAINE: Oh, we’re neighbors. I’ll be here all the time!

(Jerry is starting to regret his actions.)

JERRY: All the time.

ELAINE: (overly excited) We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this is going to be great!

JERRY: All the time.



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like you’re always making a movie. You mess up, somebody just walks on the set, and stops the whole shot. You know what I mean? Think of the things you wish you could take back. You’re out somewhere with people, “Gee, you look pregnant.. are you?” “Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, that’s not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Let’s take this whole scene again. People, think about what you’re saying!”



INT. MONK’S DINER – NIGHT

(George pays his bill at the cashier.)

GEORGE: Thanks, see you later, Donna.

(George walks outside.)



EXT. MONK’S DINER – CONTINUING

(George runs into Jerry outside the restaurant.)

GEORGE: What happened to you?

JERRY: You can’t believe what I just did.

GEORGE: What? What did you do?

JERRY: I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn’t believe it. It’s not believable.

GEORGE: What did you do?

JERRY: How could I have done that?

GEORGE: Done what?

JERRY: I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building. She’s going to move in.

GEORGE: Elaine’s moving into your building?

JERRY: Yes. Right above me.

GEORGE: Right above you?

JERRY: Yeah.

GEORGE: You’re gonna be neighbors.

JERRY: I know. Neighbors.

GEORGE: She’s right above you?

JERRY: Right above me.

GEORGE: How could you do that?

JERRY: ‘Cause I’m an idiot! You may think you’re an idiot, but with all due respect, I’m a much bigger idiot than you are.

GEORGE: Don’t insult me, my friend. Remember who you’re talking to. No one’s a bigger idiot than me.

JERRY: Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?

GEORGE: Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Pocono’s?

JERRY: She’s right in my building! Right above me! Every time I come in the building, I’m gonna have to sneak around like a cat burglar.

GEORGE: You’re doomed. You’re gonna have to have all your sex at women’s apartments. It’ll be like a permanent road trip. Forget about the home bed advantage.

JERRY: But I need the home bed advantage.

GEORGE: Of course. We all do.

JERRY: Come in for two minutes and sit with me.

GEORGE: I was just in there. It’s embarrassing.

JERRY: Oh, who’s gonna know?

GEORGE: They saw me walk out.

JERRY: Two minutes.

(Jerry opens the door. George gestures to the people in the window of the coffee shop that he has no choice. They enter.)



INT. MONK’S DINER – LATER

(Jerry and George are at a booth.)

JERRY: My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don’t make a mistake? He went for a cup of coffee. And in that second ruined my life.

GEORGE: My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic. Emotionally exhausted.

JERRY: So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?

GEORGE: Tough.

JERRY: You know, the water pressure’s terrible in my building. And she loves a good shower.

GEORGE: I never heard of anyone would turned down an apartment because of a weak shower spray.

JERRY: If they were fanatic about showers, they might.

GEORGE: For that rent, she’d take a bath in the toilet tank if she had to.

(There’s a woman at the counter feeding her kid, who sits in a stroller.)

JERRY: Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting, coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn’t that child abuse?

GEORGE: I’d like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date first... Remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?

JERRY: Yeah, the guy with the flat head.

GEORGE: He’s a cube. Anyway, he got married six months ago. He told me ever since he’s been wearing a wedding band, women have been coming on to him everywhere he goes.

JERRY: Yeah, I’ve heard that about wedding bands.

GEORGE: I wonder if that’s really true.

JERRY: That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You know, Kramer has his father’s band. He’d loan it to you.

(George laughs at the idea)



INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY – DAY

(Outside Kramer’s apartment. George has Kramer’s father’s band on. Kramer is in the doorway.)

GEORGE: Thanks a lot. I’ll give it back to you in a week.

KRAMER: You know, I don’t even know why you’re fooling around with this ring. I’ve been telling you, get yourself some plugs. Or a piece.

GEORGE: I’m not doing that.

KRAMER: Oh, man. You know, you’re crazy. You’re a good looking guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?

GEORGE: No, I’ll put half a can of mousse in my head like you.

(Harold and Manny are arguing down the hall.)

HAROLD: I told you I don’t like these sponges, they’re too small! I want a big sponge!

(Manny yells in Spanish.)

HAROLD: You can’t pick up anything with these! There’s no absorption!

(Manny yells in Spanish. Jerry exits his apartment.)

JERRY: Boys, boys.

HAROLD: Hi, Jerry.

MANNY: Hello, Jerry. (in spanish to Harold) You tell him.

HAROLD: Okay

MANNY: (in spanish to Harold again) You tell him.

HAROLD: Your friend can’t have the apartment, Jerry.

JERRY: What?

HAROLD: Because somebody offered Manny five thousand dollars for the apartment. I don’t want to do it. Manny wants to do it.

MANNY: (in spanish) Why are you telling him it's my fault?

HAROLD: Because it’s true! Why shouldn’t I tell him?

JERRY: Hey, hey. I understand. You’re businessmen.

MANNY: (in spanish) Tell him that if his friend can come up with the same money then she can have the apartment.

HAROLD: Oh, now, he says that if your friend has five thousand dollars, we’ll give it to her.

JERRY: Well, that’s a lot of money. But, if that’s the way it’s gotta be, that’s the way it’s gotta be.

(Jerry returns to his own apartment.)



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(George is there. Jerry enters.)

JERRY: You know, I used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events, but I see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.

GEORGE: What happened to you?

JERRY: Religion, my friend, that’s what happened to me. Because, I have just been informed that it’s going to cost Elaine the sum of five thousand dollars to get the apartment upstairs.

GEORGE: (jubilant) Five thousand dollars? She doesn’t have five thousand dollars!

JERRY: Of course she doesn’t have five thousand dollars!

GEORGE: So, she can’t get the apartment.

JERRY: Can’t get it.

GEORGE: So, she doesn’t move in.

JERRY: No move. So, you see, it’s all part of a divine plan.

GEORGE: And how does the baldness fit into that plan?

(The intercom buzzes. Jerry presses the first button.)

JERRY: (to the intercom) Elaine?

ELAINE: Yeah.

(Jerry opens his door.)

JERRY: (to George) All right, this is going to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I’m disappointed. You’re going to really see me being a phony, now. I hope you can take this. Maybe you should go in the other room.

GEORGE: Are you kidding? I lie every second of the day. My whole life is a sham!

JERRY: ‘Cause you know, I love Elaine.

GEORGE: Of course you do.

JERRY: But you know... not in the building. Really, I feel terrible about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me.

(Elaine appears in the doorway.)

ELAINE: (to someone in the hallway) No, I’ll be seeing you. (She enters the apartment; singing) "Good morning, good morning..” (to Jerry and George) Have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt it’s great to be alive? That every breath is a gift of sweet life from above?

(George looks at Jerry then head into the other room.)

ELAINE: Oh, and before I forget, I have the checks for the first month, last month’s security deposit. (laughs) I have seventy-five dollars left in my account.

JERRY: Well... there’s a little bit of a problem.

ELAINE: Oh, I know. There’s a weak shower spray, I know. I’ve already thought about it, and I’m switching to baths. As Winston Churchill said, “Why stand when you can sit?” Maybe I’ll get some rubber duckies.

JERRY: Uh, no uh, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the apartment. I’m sure they’d just as soon give it to you, but you’d have to come up with that money.

ELAINE: Five thousand dollars? I don’t have five thousand dollars.

JERRY: I know.

ELAINE: (disappointed) How am I going to get five thousand dollars?

JERRY: I have no idea.

(Kramer enters.)

KRAMER: (to Elaine) Hey, my new neighbor!

ELAINE: I’m not moving in.

KRAMER: What?

ELAINE: They want five thousand dollars now.

KRAMER: So, okay uh what’s the problem?

ELAINE: I don’t have five thousand dollars.

KRAMER: C’mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars. (to Jerry) Jerry, you don’t have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.

JERRY: Yeah, well, I didn’t- Is that something you want to borrow?

ELAINE: No, that’s too much money to borrow.

KRAMER: Loan her the money. You can afford it.

JERRY: She doesn’t wanna borrow the money.

KRAMER: Oh, c’mon. She’ll pay you back. What’s five grand between friends?

ELAINE: Of course I’d pay you back..

KRAMER: Yeah, so what’s the problem?

JERRY: Who said there’s a problem?

KRAMER: Hey see He said he’d loan you the money.

ELAINE: Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back. Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?

(Jerry opens his mouth.)

KRAMER: That’s okay. He doesn’t care.

ELAINE: Well, you know, money can sometimes come between friends.

(Jerry opens his mouth.)

KRAMER: Get outta here.

ELAINE: Let me think about it.

KRAMER: What’s to think about?

ELAINE: I don’t know... I don’t know. Five thousand... let me just take one more look at it.

(She leaves.)

JERRY: (to Kramer) It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand. Where’s she gonna get five thousand? She doesn’t have five thousand. Clean. Good bye. She’s gone. Then you come in, “Why don’t you loan her five thousand? What do you care? You’ve got five thousand. Give her five thousand!”

KRAMER: You didn’t want her in the building?

JERRY: No, I didn’t!

KRAMER: Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for? Oh, look, maybe she won’t take it. I mean, she did say that she was gonna think about it.

JERRY: People don’t turn down money. It’s what separates us from the animals.

KRAMER: I still don’t understand what the problem is having her in the building.

JERRY: Let me explain something to you. You see, you’re not normal. You’re a great guy, I love you, but you’re a pod. I, on the other hand, am a human being. I sometimes feel awkward, uncomfortable, even inhibited in certain situations with the other human beings. You wouldn’t understand.

KRAMER: Because I’m a pod?

(George returns from Jerry’s bedroom just as Elaine returns.)

ELAINE: I’ll take it!

(George turns on his heels, and goes back into Jerry’s room.)



INT. ROXANNE’S APARTMENT

(Guests are milling around, eating. Elaine enters with Jerry and George. Roxanne greets them.)

ROXANNE: Hi, Elaine.

ELAINE: Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends. This is George, and this is Jerry.

(Jerry and George greet Roxanne.)

JERRY: Hi

ELAINE: Jerry’s the one who got me my new apartment.

ROXANNE: So, you’re Elaine’s hero.

JERRY: Yes, it’s my life’s work.

ROXANNE: There are so few true heroes left in this world.

GEORGE: Yeah, my wife couldn’t make it today. She’s got something with her mother... Who knows what’s going on with her. Don’t let any one kid you, it’s tough.

(George goes off to mingle.)

JERRY: Well, better load up on some carbos before the race.

(Jerry starts selecting food from the tables.)

ROXANNE: Oh, the marathon is great, isn’t it?

JERRY: Oh, yes. Particularly if you’re not in it.

ROXANNE: I wish we had a view of the finish line.

JERRY: What’s to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and twenty thousand losers.

(George is talking to a woman, RITA by the couch.)

GEORGE: ...yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today. I’m tellin’ you, it’s one thing after another.

RITA: Is she here?

GEORGE: Uh no no, she’s working.

RITA: What does she do?

GEORGE: She’s an... etymologist. You know, bees, flies, gnats. W-What about you?

RITA: I work for the Director of Madison Square Garden. It’s great! I can get free tickets to any sporting in New York. Anyway, she’s a very luck woman. Enjoy the race.

(The woman leaves.)

GEORGE: (calling after her) But..

(STAN and JOANNE enter the apartment.)

ROXANNE: Hi Stan. Joanne.

ELAINE: Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. They’re in my short story class with Roxanne and me.

JERRY: Hi how are ya?

ELAINE: Hey, Jerry just got me a great apartment in his building!

JOANNE: Well, Jerry, it’ll be nice having a close friend nearby.

JERRY: (no amused) Fantastic.

STAN: She can pop in whenever she wants.

JERRY: I know.

JOANNE: She doesn’t even need to knock!

JERRY: It’s tremendous.

STAN: Anytime of day.

JERRY: I’m in heaven.

ELAINE: Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. He’s the one who got me the apartment.

RITA: Oh, hi. (calling to someone) Bob, this is the guy who got Elaine the apartment.

(George is talking to another woman, SUSIE whom he sits next to on the couch.)

GEORGE: I’m sorry, I don’t see the big deal about being a matador. The bull charges, you move the cape, what’s so hard?

(The both laugh.)

SUSIE: So uh, are you really married? Because, I’ve actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attract women.

GEORGE: (laughs) You’d have to be a real loser to try something like that.

SUSIE: That’s too bad, because I really have a thing for bald guys with glasses.

(Susie shrugs, smiles, then leaves George’s side.)

RITA: Hey everybody! Here come the runners!

(Everyone runs to the windows. Jerry and Elaine stay put.)

ELAINE: (to Jerry) So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?

JERRY: Oh, I wouldn’t quite say that.

ELAINE: Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to her.

JERRY: I’m a guy – it always looks like that.

ELAINE: Because, I was thinking... are you at all concerned that living in the same building will, y’know... cramp our styles?

JERRY: Nah...

ELAINE: Because, I was worried that there might be a situation in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little uncomfortable. But, as long as you’re okay with it, it’s fine with me.

(Jerry opens his mouth to say something, but Elaine leaves. George is now sitting beside JANICE.)

JANICE: I’ve never been able to be with just one person. I can, however, carry on strictly physical relationships which can last for years and years. It’s a shame you’re married.

(Janice gets up. George frantically tries to take the ring off.)

GEORGE: Umm, I’m not. It’s just a sociological experiment!

JANICE: Please...

(George stands up. She leaves George, who proceeds to the snack table. Jerry walks over to him.)

JERRY: You have no idea what an idiot is. Elaine just gave me a chance to get out and I didn’t take it. (pointing to himself) This is an idiot.

GEORGE: Is that right? I just threw away a lifetime of guilt-free sex, and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison Square Garden. So please, a little respect. For I am Costanza: Lord of the Idiots!

ROXANNE: (yelling out the window) You’re all winners!

GEORGE: But suddenly, a new contender has emerged...



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – DAY

(Jerry is talking on the phone with George.)

JERRY: George, I didn’t sleep at all last night. I decided I have to tell her. I’m just going to be honest. That’s all... Yes, I’m nervous... Are you listening to me?... Just put some soap on your finger. It’ll slide right off... Then try axle grease... (Kramer enters; to the phone) I’ll call you back after I talk to her... Bye.

KRAMER: Well, it’s all taken care of. Everything’s cool.

JERRY: What? What’s cool?

KRAMER: Elaine.

JERRY: What are you talking about?

KRAMER: I just found a guy who’s willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the apartment.

JERRY: You what?! Get out! (pushes Kramer) Ten thousand?

KRAMER: Cash.

JERRY: Who would pay that much?

KRAMER: He’s in the music business.

JERRY: Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Jerry hugs Kramer, then grabs him by the cheeks.) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful! I think I’m in the clear here. Elaine’s not moving in. I don’t have to confront her. She has no idea I never wanted her to move in. I’m golden!

KRAMER: Well, occasionally I like to help the humans.



INT. JERRY’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

(The door to Jerry’s apartment is open. Harold and Manny, and Elaine are there. Pulsing music is emanating through the walls.)

ELAINE: Wow. You’re right. That is loud.

JERRY: It’s just unbelievable.

ELAINE: They rehearse all the time?

JERRY: All the time. I’ve been up there six times. They refuse to stop. I can’t live like this. I don’t know what I’m gonna do. I’m heading for breakdown! (to Harold) Can’t you do something?

HAROLD: I’m not going up. It stinks up there.

JERRY: Manny...

MANNY: (in Spanish) They’re allowed to play until eleven o’clock!

HAROLD: I’m not the one who said eleven o’clock. He makes up his own rules.

ELAINE: Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you’d never hear a peep out of me. I’m as quiet as a mouse.

(Kramer enters, and hears the music.)

KRAMER: Oh, I love the one they do right after this one! (Starts dancing)



INT. COMEDY CLUB – NIGHT

(Jerry is on stage, performing.)

JERRY: I don’t know. What do you do when a neighbor is making, like, a lot of noise at three o’clock in the morning? I mean, can you knock on someone’s door and tell them to keep it down? You’re really altering your whole self-image. I mean, what am I, Fred Mertz now? What’s happening to me? Can I do this? Am I a shusher? I used to be a shushee. There’s a lot of shushing going on in movie theaters. People are always shushing. “Shh... shh... shhh... shhh...” Doesn’t work, ‘cause nobody knows where a shush is coming from. They just hear a shh. “Was that a shush? I think somebody just shushed me.” Some people you can’t shush in a movie theater. There’s always that certain group of people, isn’t it? They’re talking and talking, and everyone around them is shushing them, and shushing them. They won’t shush. They’re the unshushables.


The End
